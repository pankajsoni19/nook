/**
 * Vault rate limits (vault plan §7, T194, T195): reveals and value reads 300 per 10 minutes per
 * person, writes 300 per 10 minutes, exports 10 an hour, and failed protected-environment
 * re-authentication attempts 10 per 10 minutes per session (Wave 26). Counters live in SQLite (`vault_rate_limits`), so a restart
 * does not reset them. Each bucket is a sliding window estimated from the current and previous fixed
 * windows (the previous one weighted by how much of it still overlaps). A refused request costs
 * nothing and gets 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `retryAfterSeconds`: the time until the request would fit
 * (`slidingWaitMs`), not just until the current window ends.
 *
 * Wave 27 adds per-key buckets for `nkv_` keys (T183, T191, T192), lower than a person's: reads 20 a
 * minute and 1,000 an hour, writes 10 a minute and 200 a day, and value reads over MCP 60 an hour
 * (the plan's §7.1 cap, since those values leave the host). A key's calls charge only the key's
 * buckets, so a busy CI job cannot lock its creator out of the app. A refusal is a `KeyLimitError`;
 * the REST and MCP layers record the `key.vault.limited` alert when they see one.
 *
 * Detection below the limits (V-O6, review M1): every value a key reads also counts in its
 * `keyReadDayAlert` bucket, which never refuses; passing 500 in a UTC day alerts the creator
 * (`key.vault.volume`, server/vault/keyApi.ts), since a key paced under the limits could otherwise
 * read up to 24,000 values a day unnoticed.
