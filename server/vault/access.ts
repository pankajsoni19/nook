/**
 * The single access predicate of the Vault (vault plan §6.1, D213–D216, D226, T181). Every vault read
 * and write asks here first, and only this module can mint the `VaultGrant` that `crypto.ts` needs to
 * decrypt or encrypt anything: a route that forgets the check cannot reach plaintext.
 *
 * Levels per environment: none < read < write < admin. Owners hold admin on every environment
 * (D214). A member's level is the highest of their own row in `vault_env_access` and the groups they
 * are in (`group_grants` with `resource_kind = 'vault'` and one row per environment; view → read,
 * edit → write, manage → admin). Someone reached only through a group is a member. The Team role
 * caps it: admins and members have no cap, viewers read at most, and guests, blocked accounts, and
 * integrations reach nothing (V-O3; integrations are never vault members, Wave 26). Admins get no
 * implicit access (D73). A vault, environment, or secret that is missing, binned, being purged, or
 * not readable is the same 404; a level too low on an environment the caller can already see is 403
 * `VAULT_LEVEL`.
 *
 * Protected environments (D226, V-O2): a READ grant for one of them is minted only while the
 * session's re-authentication window is open (password plus TOTP, 15 minutes,
 * `sessions.vault_reauth_at`); otherwise 403 `REAUTH_REQUIRED`. Every read of such an environment's
 * values (a value, reveal, a version, export) goes through a read grant, so the window is enforced
 * in one place. Writes (2026-10-06 operator: no re-auth for writes) mint a write grant without the
 * window: the signed-in session holder changes values with normal write access, CSRF, CAS, quota,
 * and rate limits. A write grant may open a stored value inside the server (restoring a version,
 * keeping a comment on import), but no write ever returns plaintext. Lifting protection and
 * deleting a protected environment still need the window (`requireUnlocked`). Metadata (names,
 * versions list, statuses) needs no window.
 *
 * Actors: sessions, and `nkv_` vault keys (Wave 27). A key's level on an environment is its grant ∩
 * the creator's live level ∩ the creator's role cap (D218), recomputed on every call: a creator who
 * loses access narrows the key at once, and a blocked or retired creator disables it (the key layer
 * refuses it before it gets here). A key is never an owner here (owner-only operations, members,
 * and access are session-only, D219), and a grant never exceeds `write`. Protected environments over
 * keys: a key reaches one only when a grant names that environment explicitly AND the key carries
 * `protectedAccess` (chosen at creation, under its re-authentication) AND the environment was
 * protected when that grant was made (so the re-authentication covered it); a grant over every
 * environment never covers a protected one. So a key needs no session window: the rule is in its
 * level.
