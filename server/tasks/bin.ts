/**
 * Cards and boards in the shared Bin (WAVES_7-9.md D41 and §3.3). Deleting only sets the Bin
 * columns (service.ts). Here:
 *
 * - Listing: a binned board for its owner; a binned card for the board owner and for the member
 *   who deleted it, while that member can still open the board.
 * - Restore: compare-and-swap under the board lock, by the board owner or the card's deleter. A
 *   card whose column was deleted returns to the first column, at the bottom; Undo may ask for its
 *   old column and neighbour, honoured while both are still there. A card on a binned
 *   board is refused with BOARD_IN_BIN.
 * - Purge: board owner only (and the sweeper). Cards and boards have no bytes, so the tombstone and
 *   the delete share one transaction. Attachments that lose their last link move to their
 *   uploader's Bin (director review §7).
 * - Subtrees (research 2026-09-26 D129, D130, T114): binning a card bins its live descendants,
 *   tagged `bin_root_id = <root>`. Only roots are Bin items (listed with `descendant_count`);
 *   restoring the root restores exactly its group, and purging it purges the group. A descendant
 *   binned on its own first is its own root and keeps its entry. A root restored while its parent
 *   is binned (or gone) comes back detached.
