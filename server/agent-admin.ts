/**
 * Host CLI for the Chat module's key (agent chat plan §4.2, D354, review M3). Run it on the host with
 * the same environment (DATA_DIR and the key variables) as the server. It prints counts and key
 * fingerprints (the first 8 hex digits of the key's SHA-256) only, never keys or provider names.
 *
 *   bun server/agent-admin.ts verify-key
 *     Checks that AGENT_SECRETS_KEY (or AGENT_SECRETS_KEY_FILE) opens every stored provider secret
 *     and prints the key's fingerprint. Exit 0 when all open, 1 when any does not, 2 on a usage error.
 *
 *   bun server/agent-admin.ts rotate-key [--key-saved]
 *     Re-seals every stored provider secret from the current key to a new one, in one transaction.
 *     The new key comes from AGENT_SECRETS_KEY_NEW_FILE, a file the operator generated first (so the
 *     key that now opens every secret is known to be kept somewhere); AGENT_SECRETS_KEY_NEW (inline)
 *     is accepted only with `--key-saved`. Refused while a server is using DATA_DIR (its heartbeat,
 *     `server/serverHeartbeat.ts`, as `vault-admin.ts rotate-kek`): a running server would keep
 *     sealing new keys with the old one. See docs/OPERATIONS.md, Agent chat.
