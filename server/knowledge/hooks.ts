/**
 * Hooks other modules call without importing the knowledge module (no import cycles):
 * - Notes tells it a note was published (plan §9: a source re-indexes after a publish, debounced 60 s).
 * - Notes, Files, and folders tell it who can read an item changed: its sharing, the Bin, a restore,
 *   or a purge (Wave 44 fixes, M1). A source its base's owner can no longer read loses its chunks at once.
 * - Team tells it an account was unblocked (M2): that owner's bases resume indexing; and (2026-10-08)
 *   that people joined or left a group, or a group was deleted: their bases' sources are checked again.
 * - Settings → AI tells it a provider changed or was removed (M3), or the budgets were raised (LOW-3).
 * Every hook runs its listeners after the caller's own write, and never throws.
