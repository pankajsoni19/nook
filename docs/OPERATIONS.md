# Operating Nook

This guide is for whoever runs a Nook server: installation, configuration, storage, backups, and upgrades. For using the apps, see [USING.md](USING.md). The same material is published at [pankajsoni19.github.io/nook](https://pankajsoni19.github.io/nook/).

Internal identifiers keep the original `mynotes` prefix for compatibility with existing deployments: the `mynotes.sqlite` database, the `mynotes_session` cookie, the `mynotes` container name, the `MYNOTES_DATA_DIR` variable and its `/srv/mynotes` default, and the `mynotes-*.tar.gz` backup archives.

## Install

1. Clone the repository and copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you need to override the defaults.
2. Ensure `/srv/mynotes` exists and is writable by UID 1000, or set `MYNOTES_DATA_DIR` to another host directory.
3. Run `APP_VERSION=0.25.0 GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) docker compose up -d --build`.
4. Open `http://localhost:2026` and create the first account.

### Accounts

The first account can always be created from the login screen while the database is empty. Later registrations are disabled by default. To add people, an admin creates an invite link in **Team → Invites** (below); `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` can stay `false`. Setting it to `true` temporarily still works for trusted local users, but turn it off again. Set `ALLOWED_EMAILS` to a comma-separated allowlist; when present, only those addresses may register, sign in, or keep an existing session. "Everyone here" sharing includes all current and future registered users on that allowlist, except accounts with the guest team role.

### Invites instead of ALLOW_REGISTRATION

Admins add people with single-use invite links from **Team → Invites** (see [USING.md](USING.md#inviting-people)). Keep `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false`: a valid invite bypasses only that switch. It fixes the team role (member, viewer, or guest), works once, lasts at most 7 days, and stops working when the admin who made it is no longer an active admin. `ALLOWED_EMAILS` still applies to invitees, and an invite bound to an address works only for that address. No environment change is needed.

The link carries its token in the URL fragment (`/register#invite=…`), which browsers never send to the server, so reverse-proxy access logs and `Referer` headers do not see it; the app removes it from the address bar on arrival. Treat a copied link like a password until it is used or expires, and revoke it if it went to the wrong place. Migration `018_team_invites` adds the table; back up before upgrading.

### Team admins and blocking

Every account has a team role: **admin**, **member**, **viewer** (reads what is shared with them or with everyone, changes nothing), or **guest** (reads only what is shared with them by name, never "Everyone here" items; no API keys). The first account created on an empty database is the admin. Accounts registered after it get `SIGNUP_ROLE`, which defaults to `guest`: a new account sees nothing until someone shares with it by name or an admin changes its role. Set `SIGNUP_ROLE=member` to keep the behaviour of earlier releases, or `viewer`; `admin` is refused at startup. When an existing install upgrades to the release with Team (migration 017), every account becomes a member and the **oldest enabled account becomes the admin**; change it with the command below if that is wrong. Admins manage roles, block and unblock accounts, and sign accounts out everywhere from the **Team** app. Nook always keeps at least one active admin: the last one cannot be demoted or blocked, in the app or in the database.

Blocking an account signs it out on every device at once and removes its push subscriptions. Its MCP keys and calendar feeds pause and resume when it is unblocked; its content stays where it is and stays shared as before. A blocked user who enters the right password is told the account is blocked; a wrong password still gets the usual error.

The host CLI is the way out of an admin lockout, for example when the only admin was blocked or is no longer on `ALLOWED_EMAILS`: it lists accounts (integrations are marked "(integration)"), promotes another account to admin (`set-role`), or unblocks one. It does not manage integrations: those are managed in Team → Integrations. It cannot set a password: a forgotten password needs **Forgot password?** on the sign-in page (with email on) or another admin account. Each change is recorded in the Team activity log as made from the command line:

```sh
docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts list
docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts set-role user@example.com admin
docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts set-role user@example.com member
docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts set-role user@example.com viewer
docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts set-role user@example.com guest
docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts unblock user@example.com
```

A role change applies to the account's next request. `set-role` refuses to demote the last active admin; promote another account first.

**Upgrade note (migration 017).** On upgrade the oldest account becomes admin; fix with `docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts set-role <email> admin`. If every account was disabled when 017 ran, nobody is promoted and there is no active admin: the server logs a warning naming this command at every start until one exists. Unblock the account first (`docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts unblock <email>`), then run `set-role`. While there is no active admin and `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true`, the next account registered becomes the admin (recorded in the Team activity log as a bootstrap), so keep registration off until the CLI has fixed it.

### API key policies

API keys ("Nook keys", migration 025) are governed by team policies that admins set in **Team → Policies** and that the server checks on every key call. Defaults: new keys expire after 90 days and at most 365; an expiry is **not** required yet, so keys created before migration 025 (which have none) keep working; 10 live keys per person; MCP for admins, members, and viewers; REST (arriving later) for admins and members; every module allowed for every role. New keys use MCP unless their creator picks REST (Wave 34); a key works on a surface only while its owner's role is in that surface's list, checked on every call. Turning on **Require an expiry** or lowering the longest lifetime **blocks** keys that break the rule (`403 KEY_POLICY` on `/mcp`) without revoking them, so loosening the policy brings them back; the page previews how many keys a change blocks. With **Require an expiry** on, a key without one is **blocked, not revoked**: its row says "Blocked by team policy: keys need an expiry. Rotate it to give it one.", and it works again once rotated with an expiry or when the policy is turned off. Plan to turn on Require an expiry in the next release and ask people to rotate old keys first (Team → Keys, state **No expiry**, lists them). Team → Keys also revokes any key with a reason the owner sees. Policies, key creation, rotation, narrowing, and revocation are recorded in the append-only `access_events` table (ids, counts, and setting names only; never secrets or reasons). Keys never change policies, keys, or sharing. Vault keys (`nkv_`, Wave 27) follow the same expiry, count, and surface policies, always expire, and are not shaped by the per-role module list; see Vault → Vault keys below.

### Central access management

Admins see what one person can open from **Team → a member → Access** (`/settings/team/members/<id>/access`): per module, what is shared with them directly, through groups, and with everyone, plus their groups, API keys, calendar feeds, and routines. Titles of items the admin cannot open themselves stay hidden ("Board owned by Carol"). From there admins can only take access away: remove or lower a direct share, take the person out of a group, revoke a key, or **Reset access** (every direct share, group membership, key, and calendar feed, and pauses routines; their own items and everything shared with everyone stay). Owners get a line on their bell when an admin removes or lowers someone's access to their item, so offboarding is visible to them and reversible by sharing again. **Team → Templates** holds a team role plus groups; pick one on an invite and the new account joins those groups when it registers. **Team → Access activity** lists key, group, item-access, policy, and template changes. Everyone but guests sees their own access in **Settings → My access**.

The rows on the access page carry short-lived handles sealed with a key that exists only in the running server, so an admin page left open across a restart simply asks for a reload. Migration **032** (`access_central`) adds the table behind those bell lines (`access_notices`, ids and counts only, swept after 30 days like reminders), stores on each invite the groups its template had when the invite was created (editing a template later changes only new invites), and adds an index for the activity view; back up before upgrading, as for any migration.

### Two-factor authentication

Generate a server-side encryption key and keep it only in `.env`:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Set the output as `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Set `TOTP_POLICY=optional` to let each user choose, or `TOTP_POLICY=required` to force enrollment before notes can be accessed. Users enroll under **Settings → Security** by scanning the locally generated QR code with Google Authenticator and verifying one six-digit code. Sign-in uses the current six-digit number or one complete, one-time recovery code. TOTP secrets and recovery codes are encrypted in SQLite with AES-256-GCM; changing or losing the encryption key makes existing enrollments unusable.

If a user loses their authenticator, the local machine administrator can reset that factor. This revokes every session and forces fresh enrollment on the next password sign-in:

```sh
docker compose exec mynotes bun server/reset-totp.ts user@example.com
```

### Vault

The Vault keeps a team's secrets (API keys, database URLs, passwords) per environment. Its values and comments are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM under a data key per vault, and those data keys are wrapped by one server key, `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. **Encrypted at rest; anyone with the server and its key can read every secret.** It is not end-to-end encryption: the server decrypts a value whenever someone allowed to read it asks. Names, environment names, and tags are stored in plain text.

The module is off until the key is set. Generate one, different from `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Set it as `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env`, or put it in a root-only file (or a Docker secret) and set `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` to that file's absolute path; not both. Nook refuses to start when the key is malformed, equal to `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, or in a file inside `DATA_DIR` (the backup script archives that directory). At startup it logs one line: the vault is on, off because no key is set, or off because the key does not open the vaults stored here (the rest of Nook keeps running). Without the key, admins see a "not configured" screen in the Vault and everyone else does not see the module at all.

**Keep the key away from the backup location.** Backups hold only ciphertext and wrapped keys, so a stolen archive alone reveals nothing, but an archive together with the key reveals every secret. Store the key somewhere other than where the archives go (a password manager, a separate secrets store, a different machine), unlike the general advice for `.env` below.

**Losing the key loses every vault.** There is no recovery without it: restoring a backup needs the key the vaults were created with. Check a key against the stored vaults at any time (it prints counts only):

```sh
docker compose exec app bun server/vault-admin.ts verify-key
```

It also prints the key's fingerprint (the first 8 hex digits of its SHA-256), so you can tell which of two keys is configured without showing either.

**Rotating the key** re-wraps the data keys only (seconds; values are not re-encrypted). After the rotation the new key is the only one that opens the vaults, so it goes into a file first, before anything changes. The commands below use the compose service name `app` from `compose.yaml`; `/path/outside/data` stands for any directory outside `DATA_DIR` and away from the backup location.

1. Generate the new key into a file readable only by you, check it is one 44-character line, and let the container user (uid 1000 in `compose.yaml`) read it:

   ```sh
   (umask 077; openssl rand -base64 32 > /path/outside/data/vault.key.new)
   test "$(tr -d '\n' < /path/outside/data/vault.key.new | wc -c)" -eq 44 && echo "key file OK"
   sudo chown 1000:1000 /path/outside/data/vault.key.new   # skip when you are uid 1000
   ```

2. Take a backup and stop the app. `rotate-kek` refuses to run while a server is using `DATA_DIR`: the server rewrites `DATA_DIR/server.heartbeat` every 5 seconds, and the file counts as stale 15 seconds after the last write (a stopped container never removes it); the command waits up to 20 seconds for it to go stale.

   ```sh
   ./scripts/backup.sh --force
   docker compose stop app
   ```

3. Run the rotation with the new key file mounted read-only (the current key comes from `.env` as usual; if you use `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`, mount that file too):

   ```sh
   docker compose run --rm \
     -v /path/outside/data/vault.key.new:/run/secrets/vault.key.new:ro \
     -e VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_NEW_FILE=/run/secrets/vault.key.new \
     app bun server/vault-admin.ts rotate-kek
   ```

   It prints the fingerprints of both keys (the first 8 hex digits of each key's SHA-256; never the keys) and the next steps. A key given inline in `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_NEW` is refused unless you add `--key-saved`, your statement that you saved that exact key elsewhere; nothing prints it back to you.

4. Replace the configured key with the new one: set `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env` to the contents of `vault.key.new`, or point `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` at that file (mounted into the container). Started with the old key, the app keeps running with the vault module off.

5. Start the app and check the key. `verify-key` must print the new fingerprint that `rotate-kek` printed and open every data key:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d app
   docker compose exec app bun server/vault-admin.ts verify-key
   ```

Keep the old key: archives taken before the rotation still need it, so keep it until those archives have rotated out. Keep `vault.key.new` (or move the key to your password manager and delete the file) like any other copy of the key.

What else to know:

- Deleted vaults, environments, and secrets stay in the Bin for 30 days. Deleting a vault forever deletes its data key, so nothing of it can be decrypted again; older backup archives keep the ciphertext (and the old wrapped key) for up to about five weeks, as for notes. After a leak, rotate the real credentials upstream: the vault cannot take back values someone already read.
- The database runs with `PRAGMA secure_delete = ON` (all modules), so deleted rows are overwritten instead of lingering in free pages.
- Vaults are shared by their owners with people and groups, with a level per environment (see USING → Vault). Team roles cap it: viewers read at most, and guests and integrations (service accounts) are never vault members and never hold vault API keys (`nkv_…` keys belong to people; see **Vault keys** below). Admins get no access to vaults they are not in; Team → a member → Access lists a person's vault memberships (names hidden unless you can open the vault) and can remove them or lower them to read, never add. Reset access removes vault memberships too (vaults the person owns stay).
- **Protected environments** (prod by default) need a fresh re-authentication for values: the password (or a Google confirmation where that is the account's method) and a two-factor code when enabled, valid 15 minutes for that browser session. The server enforces it, for owners too. Re-authentication attempts are limited to 10 per 10 minutes per person.
- **Rotating a vault's data key vs. `rotate-kek`.** `rotate-kek` (above) replaces the server key that wraps every vault's data key, on the host, with the app stopped; values are not touched. A vault's **data key** is rotated in the app (vault settings → Rotate data key, owners) and automatically whenever someone loses access to an environment: a new data key is wrapped by the current server key, new writes use it at once, and the running server re-encrypts the vault's older values, history, and comments in the background (batches of 500 rows, a short pause between them; the hourly sweep finishes any rotation a restart interrupted), then deletes the old wrapped data key. Nothing needs stopping and values stay readable throughout. It protects backups against someone who kept an old wrapped key; it does not take back values someone already read, so rotate those credentials upstream. Old archives still hold the old wrapped data key and its ciphertext until they rotate out.
- **Import and export.** Import reads `.env` (`KEY=value`, quotes, `export`, `#` comments), JSON (`{ "NAME": "value" }` or a list of `{ name, value, comment }`), or CSV (`name,value,comment` header) in the browser, at most 1 MiB and 500 entries; the server checks every entry and shows a preview before anything is written. Export writes one environment as `.env`, JSON, or CSV in plain text; each export is recorded (the vault's Activity and the audit log `vault.export`, with counts) and limited to 10 an hour per person. An export file is as sensitive as the vault: keep it off shared drives, and delete it when done.
- Every reveal, copy, write, clear, restore, import, export, and access change, and every opening of a secret's comment, is recorded in the vault's own event log (ids and counts only, never values); owners read it as the vault's **Activity**, members see their own. The hourly sweep deletes events older than 90 days; newer events cannot be deleted. Reads and writes are limited to 300 each per 10 minutes per person; the limits survive a restart.
- Vaults and secrets in the Bin count toward the limits of 100 vaults per person and 1,000 secrets per vault until they are purged. The vaults a person created may hold 64 MiB of stored ciphertext in total (values, their history, and comments, the Bin included); past that, writes that add data are refused until values are cleared or deleted items purged. When the creator stops being an owner, the longest-standing owner takes over that count.

### Passwords

People change their own password in **Settings → Security** (current password plus a two-factor code when they use one; other sessions are signed out). With email on, **Forgot password?** on the sign-in page mails a 30-minute, single-use link to an existing, unblocked, **verified** address; the answer is the same whether or not an account exists, and a reset on a two-factor account still needs a code or recovery code. A reset signs the account out everywhere and removes its push subscriptions; API keys are not revoked (the security email links to them). Requests are limited in memory like sign-in: 3 an hour per address and 10 an hour per client address. The link is built from `APP_ORIGIN`, never the request's Host header, so set it correctly behind a proxy.

Admins cannot trigger a reset email for someone else (D246: it would be a phishing surface). With email off, or for an address that was never verified, there is no self-service reset; an admin who forgot their password keeps administering through another admin account (promote one with the host CLI above if there is none). The host CLI only lists accounts, sets roles, and unblocks; `server/reset-totp.ts` clears a lost authenticator. Nook has no CLI that sets a password.

### Google sign-in

People can sign in with Google as well as, or instead of, email and password. `AUTH_METHODS` chooses: `password` (the default; nothing changes on upgrade), `google`, or `both`. The server enforces it: with `google`, password sign-in, registration, forgot/reset password, and change password all answer `PASSWORD_SIGNIN_DISABLED`; with `password`, every `/api/auth/google/*` route answers 404.

**Create the OAuth client (Google Cloud Console):**

1. Open *APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen*. Choose **Internal** for a Google Workspace organisation (only your domain can sign in) or **External** otherwise; fill in the app name and support address. The scopes Nook asks for are `openid`, `email`, and `profile` (no sensitive scopes, so no verification is needed).
2. Open *APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID*, application type **Web application**.
3. Under **Authorized redirect URIs** add exactly `APP_ORIGIN/api/auth/google/callback`, for example `https://notes.example.com/api/auth/google/callback`. Nook builds this URI from `APP_ORIGIN` only (never from the request's Host), so it must match character for character. No JavaScript origins are needed: the browser never loads a Google script.
4. Copy the client ID and secret into `.env` as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, set `AUTH_METHODS=both` (or `google`), and restart. With `google` or `both` and either value missing, the server refuses to start.

**Who can sign in.** A Google sign-in finds its account by Google's stable account id. Failing that, it links an existing account with the same address only when Nook has verified that address **and** Google manages it (a `gmail.com` address, or a Google Workspace account on that domain); otherwise the person is told the address already has an account and nothing changes (see *Linking existing accounts*). With no account at all, it creates one only when registration would allow it: the first account on an empty instance (it becomes the admin), a valid invite (the invite page offers **Continue with Google**; an invite bound to an address needs the same Google address), or `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true` (with `SIGNUP_ROLE`). `ALLOWED_EMAILS` applies to Google exactly as to passwords. `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=example.com` (comma-separated) lets only Google accounts on a listed domain, whose Workspace `hd` claim matches it, sign in or be created with Google. It restricts **Google sign-in only**: password registration is still governed by `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` and `ALLOWED_EMAILS`. Blocked accounts stay blocked, and accounts with two-factor on still enter their Nook code after Google.

**Linking existing accounts.** Nook never links Google to an account whose address it has not verified, and never resets an account on its own: someone else may have registered the address first. With email off, no address is ever verified (only accounts made through Google or a bound invite are), so existing password accounts always take one of these ways:

1. **Settings (password sign-in on):** the person signs in with their password, opens **Settings → Security → Link Google**, confirms their password (and two-factor code), and chooses the Google account with the same address. That Google account must be the address's owner too: a Gmail address, or a Google Workspace account on the address's own domain; a personal Google account that only uses a company address is refused. The address becomes verified.
2. **An admin allows it:** **Team → the person → Allow Google sign-in…**, confirming with the admin's own password (and two-factor code). The next Google sign-in with that address, within 24 hours, links the account, once. Only a Google account that Google confirms is managed by the address's domain can use an allowance (a Google Workspace account of that domain, or the Gmail account itself for a Gmail address); a personal Google account that merely uses the address is refused with a message naming the domain, and the allowance stays for the right account. The dialog says so up front and shows the last refused Google sign-in for the account (time and reason only). For an account whose address was never verified and that is not an admin, when you do not know who created it, choose **Reset account for Google sign-in…** (not the same as **Reset access** on the Access page, which removes what others share with the person): at once, it signs the account out everywhere, revokes its API keys and calendar feed links, removes its password and two-factor setup, makes everything it owns private (removing every person and group it shared with), revokes its live invites, and pauses its routines. Content is kept. The counts are shown before you confirm and after, and the person sees a one-time notice at their next sign-in. The app refuses a reset for verified accounts (their owner is known), for admins, and for accounts that were admins at any time in the last 24 hours (demoting first does not get around it); the command line can. Admins cannot do any of this for their own account in the app. For a linked account whose owner recreated their Google account, **Allow re-linking…** lets the next Google sign-in with the same address replace the old Google account (once, within 24 hours; the old one works until then). The dialog warns that whoever next signs in with Google as that address gets the account and everything in it. When that sign-in happens, the previous holder's access ends: every session and push subscription, API keys, calendar feed links, and unused password-reset links. By default (the option **Also remove the password and two-factor**, on unless you turn it off) the password and two-factor go too, since the previous holder may know them. Content and sharing stay. The counts are shown before you confirm and after. The command line's `allow-google-link` on a linked account does the same, removing the password and two-factor unless you add `--keep-credentials` (way 3).
3. **The host command line:** `docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts allow-google-link <email> [--reset | --keep-credentials]` does the same as 2. It prints what will happen before doing it. On an account already linked to Google it allows a re-link, which by default removes the password and two-factor when the new Google account signs in, as the app's option does; add `--keep-credentials` to keep them (sessions, keys, feed links, and reset links end either way). `--keep-credentials` is refused for an account that is not linked, and with `--reset`. `unlink-google <email>` removes a linked Google account (for example when the person recreated their Google account: unlink, then allow). These work in every `AUTH_METHODS` mode and are the way out for a lone admin or a Google-only instance.

Each link, allowance, reset, re-link, and unlink is audited and, with email on, mailed to the account's address. Allowances, resets, admin unlinks, and completed re-links also reach the person's bell (ids and counts only) and **Team → Access activity** (filter **Google sign-in**).

**Passwords and re-authentication.** Accounts created through Google have no password; with the password method on and email set up, they can add one with **Forgot password?**. People unlink Google under **Settings → Security** after confirming their password (unlinking needs a password that works); the device they unlink from stays signed in and every other device is signed out. An admin's unlink (Team or `unlink-google`) signs the person out everywhere: they sign in again with their password. Where Nook asks for a password to confirm a sensitive change (API keys, two-factor, linking), an account **without a usable password** confirms with Google instead: Google asks for the Google password again, and the confirmation lasts 5 minutes on that device. Accounts that have a password always give it.

**Profile pictures.** At each Google sign-in the server downloads the Google profile picture (https from `*.googleusercontent.com` only, 5 seconds, at most 1 MiB, PNG, JPEG, or WebP by content) into `DATA_DIR/avatars/` and serves it from Nook itself; browsers never contact Google, and the Content Security Policy is unchanged. A failed download never blocks sign-in. Backups include `avatars/`; files no account uses are removed by the hourly sweep.

**Switching to Google only.** With `AUTH_METHODS=google`, password sign-in, registration, and resets are off (`/api/about` no longer offers a reset). Password-only accounts cannot sign in until they are linked: through their verified address with a Google Workspace account on that domain, or through an admin's allowance (way 2 or 3 above). Nothing is deleted. If Google sign-in breaks (a wrong secret, a changed redirect URI, Google unavailable), set `AUTH_METHODS=both` or `password` and restart; the host CLIs (`server/team-admin.ts`, `server/reset-totp.ts`) work in every mode.

**Recommended company setup.** `AUTH_METHODS=google`, `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=<your domain>`, and `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true` if everyone on the domain may join (or `false` and invites). The first Google account on an empty instance becomes the admin. If the only admin is locked out, use `team-admin.ts set-role`, `unblock`, `allow-google-link`, or `unlink-google` on the host.

#### Vault keys (`nkv_`)

People make **vault keys** in Settings → API keys (kind **Vault key**; migration **038**) for scripts, CI jobs, and AI clients. A vault key holds vault access only (vaults, one environment or every unprotected one, read or write), works only on `/api/v1/vault/*` and the vault MCP tools, and never reaches more than its creator can at the moment of each call: a creator who loses access narrows the key, and a blocked creator's keys stop. Vault keys always expire (at most 365 days, or your policy's maximum), follow the same team policies as other keys (surfaces per role, count per person), and appear in **Team → Keys** (filter **Kind: Vault keys**) with counts only, never vault names. Integrations cannot hold vault keys.

**What a leaked `nkv_` key can do** until it is revoked or expires: read the values its grants and its creator's current access allow (over REST; over MCP only if the key allows MCP value reads), write new versions of values and create secrets where it has write, and list names, tags, and metadata. It cannot delete, clear, restore, import, export, share, change members or access, rotate data keys, or make keys. Protected environments are reachable only if the key was created (or rotated) with **Allow protected environments** and a grant naming that environment while it was already protected; an environment protected later is cut off from every key until the key is rotated. Every call is in the vault's Activity with the key's name and in the key's Recent activity.

**When a vault key leaks** (committed to a repository, printed in a CI log, pasted into a chat):

1. Revoke it at once: its owner in **Settings → API keys → Revoke**, or an admin in **Team → Keys → Revoke** (with a reason the owner sees). It stops on the next call; there is no cache.
2. Look at what it did: the key's **Recent activity**, and **Activity → API keys** in each vault it reached (reads and writes, with environments and times; never values).
3. Rotate upstream every credential it could read (database passwords, API tokens), since a value read before revocation may have been copied. A vault's data-key rotation protects old backups; it does not take back what a key read.
4. If it wrote values, restore earlier versions from each secret's **History**.

**Limits** (per key, persistent in `vault_rate_limits`, so a restart does not reset them): value, comment, and old-version reads 20 a minute and 1,000 an hour; writes (values and new secrets) 10 a minute and 200 a day; values read over MCP 60 an hour. They are below a person's (300 per 10 minutes) and never charge the creator's own allowance. The general per-key REST and MCP limits (calls and writes per minute, per surface) apply as well. A key that hits a vault limit is refused with 429 and `Retry-After`; the server records `key.vault.limited` in the access log (at most once per key per 10 minutes), a `key.limited` row in the vault's Activity, and one bell notice a day to the key's creator. Below the limits, every value a key reads is also counted per UTC day (`keyReadDayAlert` in `vault_rate_limits`, never refused): the read that passes **500 in a day** records `key.vault.volume` in the access log (with the count), a `key.volume` row in that vault's Activity, and a bell notice to the creator, once a day per key, so a stolen key paced under the limits is still noticed. Frequent limit or volume notices for a key nobody expects to be busy are a reason to revoke it.

### Rate limits and reverse proxies

Nook limits sign-in attempts in memory (a restart clears them), per minute unless noted. Each limit has a scope: the **client address** (an IPv6 client counts by its /64, and every spelling of one address is one address), the **email** typed, the **account** acting, or the whole **instance**. An attempt refused by a narrower bucket does not count toward the instance-wide one, so one address cannot use up everyone's allowance; once the instance-wide bucket is full, everything is refused until the minute is over.

| What | Per client address | Per email or account | Whole instance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Password sign-in, and the Nook code step after Google | 20 | 10 per email | 120 |
| Account creation (password or Google) | 5 | none | 20 |
| Invite link preview (password or Google hand-off) | 10 | none | 60 |
| Google sign-in starts | 120 | none | 2000 |
| Google callbacks | 180 | none | 3000 |
| Unfinished Google sign-ins held | 50 started sign-ins at once (at the cap the oldest anonymous sign-in is dropped first; invite, link, and re-auth ones only when none is left; a start is never refused); separately 20 prepared invite or link hand-offs (oldest dropped among themselves) | one prepared hand-off per invite (a new one replaces it); 3 link or re-auth round trips per session | none |
| Wrong Nook codes after Google | none | 5 per sign-in attempt, then it starts over | none |
| Settings → Link or Unlink Google | none | 5 per account | none |
| Team → Google allow or unlink (acting admin) | none | 10 per admin | none |
| Password reset: request | 10 an hour | 3 an hour per email | none |
| Password reset: check or complete a link | 20 | none | none |
| Password change | none | 5 per 10 minutes per account | none |
| Email verification link | 20 | none | none |
| One-click unsubscribe | 30 | none | none |
| Calendar feed: wrong tokens | 30 | none | none (at most 1000 addresses tracked) |
| Calendar feed: fetches | none | 60 an hour per feed | none |

Nook reads the client address from the connection unless `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` says otherwise:

- **No proxy (Nook faces the network):** leave `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=0`. Each visitor has their own address.
- **One reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, Traefik) that sets `X-Forwarded-For`:** set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1`. Nook then takes the right-most `X-Forwarded-For` entry, the one your proxy added; anything a client put further left is ignored.
- **Tailscale Serve:** whether Serve adds `X-Forwarded-For` has **not been verified** for Nook. Check before you rely on it: with `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=0`, open Nook through Serve once and look at the server log. Nook logs one warning per process, `A request carried X-Forwarded-For but TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS is 0`, the first time a request carries the header (without the address). If the warning appears, Serve adds the header: set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=1` and restart. If it never appears, leave `0` (every visitor then shares Serve's address; see below).
- **Two proxies in a row:** `2`, and so on (at most 5).

**Behind a proxy, publish the port on localhost only**, or firewall it, so nobody can reach Nook around the proxy and send their own `X-Forwarded-For`. In `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:<host-port>:2026"   # only the proxy on this host can connect
```

**Name your proxies (`TRUSTED_PROXY_ADDRESSES`).** With `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` set, Nook trusts `X-Forwarded-For` from **any** connection unless you list the proxies' own addresses, and it logs one warning at startup saying so. Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_ADDRESSES` to the address (or range) your proxy connects from, for example `127.0.0.1` for a proxy on the same host, or the Docker network range (`172.16.0.0/12`) for a proxy container. Nook then reads the header only from those connections; anyone who reaches the app port directly is seen as their own address, and a key limited to addresses refuses them. This matters because Compose publishes port 2026 on every interface by default (LAN setups rely on that); if a proxy fronts Nook, either set this or publish the port on localhost only.

With the default `0` behind a proxy, every visitor shares the proxy's address: the per-address limits then apply to everyone together (20 password sign-ins a minute for the whole instance, 120 Google starts, 50 unfinished Google sign-ins). A burst of anonymous Google starts can then push out other people's sign-ins that are waiting at Google's page (they see "That took too long. Continue with Google again." and try again); invite and Settings link hand-offs have their own cap and are not pushed out by anonymous starts. Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` so each visitor counts alone. With the right setting each visitor gets those numbers alone. **Never set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` above 0 without that many proxies in front, and never with the port reachable around the proxy:** clients could then choose their own address and dodge the per-address limits. The setting affects rate limits, log entries, and which address an API key limited to addresses sees (below): it now also decides key access, so name your proxies. It never decides who can sign in or what they see.

**API keys limited to addresses.** Since Wave 34 a key can be limited to up to ten IP addresses or CIDR ranges (Settings → API keys). Nook offers and enforces this **only when `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` is 1 or more**, because with 0 Nook cannot tell a direct connection from a proxy that did not announce itself, and behind such a proxy every client would share the proxy's address. On a server without a proxy that wants address limits, put a proxy in front (or accept that they are off). If you set the value back to 0, keys that already hold a list stop working (403 `IP_NOT_ALLOWED`) until you set it again or their owners replace them: they are never let through unchecked. Team → Keys shows which keys are limited, never their addresses. A refused call shows on the owner's key row ("Last refused … not allowed from its address") and in the key's events, at most once per reason an hour; only the owner sees the first three parts of the address (or its /64).

### The REST API (`/api/v1`)

Keys whose "Where it is used" includes REST call the same tools as MCP over HTTPS: `GET /api/v1/me` (what the key can do), `GET /api/v1/tools` (the tools it may call, with input schemas), and `POST /api/v1/tools/<name>` with a JSON body. Send the key only in the `Authorization: Bearer` header; a key in a URL is refused (and should be revoked, since it may be in logs). Team policy **REST per role** (default: admins and members) decides who may use it; viewers can be allowed read-only keys. Behind a reverse proxy nothing extra is needed: pass `/api/v1` through like the rest of `/api`, keep the `Host` header, and do not add CORS headers (Nook sends none and refuses other sites' Origins). Limits are the MCP ones (120 calls and 30 writes a minute per key, 1000 and 60 per person), counted separately for REST and MCP each minute so a busy script cannot starve an AI client; daily write budgets are shared. REST has its own 24 concurrent requests (503 with `Retry-After` beyond that). Every refusal has a stable `code` (`AUTH_REQUIRED`, `KEY_INVALID`, `KEY_POLICY`, `IP_NOT_ALLOWED`, `ORIGIN_INVALID`, `HOST_INVALID`, `KEY_IN_URL`, …); a key that does not authenticate is always `KEY_INVALID`, whether it is mistyped, expired, rotated, or revoked, and the reason goes to its owner's key row only. Admins see calls per surface per day in Team → Keys; there is no per-call log screen. The API reference is in `docs/plan/API_CONTRACTS.md` ("Resource-scoped keys and REST v1").

**Upgrade note (migration 033).** 033 adds per-surface "last used" times, daily counts, and the last refused call to API keys; existing use is recorded as MCP use. Back up before upgrading, as for any migration.

### LAN and Tailscale access

`APP_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated allowlist of exact browser origins. Keep localhost and add every trusted LAN or Tailscale HTTPS origin you use, including its port when non-standard:

```dotenv
APP_ORIGINS=http://localhost:2026,http://<server-lan-ip>:2026,https://your-device.your-tailnet.ts.net
```

Docker publishes port `2026` on all host interfaces for LAN access. Prefer Tailscale Serve or a TLS reverse proxy and keep `COOKIE_SECURE=true`. Direct plain-HTTP access such as `http://<server-lan-ip>:2026` requires `COOKIE_SECURE=false`; this is less safe for notes containing credentials, even on a trusted home network. Never use a wildcard origin.

### Email (Resend)

Nook sends email through [Resend](https://resend.com): team invites, email verification, a test email, activity (assigned to you, comments on your cards, shared with you, proposals awaiting you, sprints, Bin clean-up), reminders by email and event changed or cancelled, a daily or weekly digest, password reset links (**Forgot password?** on the sign-in page), and security notices (new MCP key, role change, two-factor changes, recovery codes, password changed or reset, blocked or unblocked, signed out everywhere). Email is **off** unless `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` are both set **and** links in mail can work (see below); while it is off every "send" action says **Email is not configured**, nothing is queued, and the main action still works.

1. Verify a sending domain in Resend and create an API key with sending access only. Resend's domain setup adds SPF and DKIM; add a DMARC record too.
2. In `.env`, set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` (an address on that domain, or `Nook <nook@your-domain>`; the display name may not contain `@`). Compose passes both through. Restart the container.
3. `APP_ORIGIN` must be `https://…` (every link in mail is built from it, never from the request's Host header). A LAN or Tailscale `http://` origin works only with `MAIL_ALLOW_HTTP_LINKS=true` (a startup warning says links are not encrypted). `http://localhost` is never used for mail: the server logs "Email is off" and sends nothing.
4. In the Resend dashboard, keep **click tracking and open tracking off** for the domain. Tracked links would send credential links (invite, verify, password reset) through Resend's redirector. Nook's messages contain no images, no remote content, and no tracking of their own.
5. Anyone with Resend dashboard access can read sent messages, including invite, verification, and password reset links. Keep that access to the operator.
6. On Resend's free tier (100 a day, 3,000 a month) set `MAIL_DAILY_LIMIT=100`.

How delivery works: every mail except an invite goes through a durable outbox (`mail_outbox`), written in the same database transaction as the action that caused it. A 30-second dispatcher sends due rows, re-checking at send time that the recipient still exists, is not blocked (blocked accounts get only their security mail), has a verified address (unverified addresses get only verification and security mail), has that email type turned on, and can still open the item (titles are read at send time, never stored in the outbox). Activity mail is grouped: assignments, comments, and shares for 10 minutes, proposals for up to an hour and at most one every 3 hours. Quiet hours hold activity mail; security mail is never held, and neither are reminder emails or event changed/cancelled emails (they are time-bound: the person chose the reminder's time, D242). Digests are scheduled from each person's own zone and time (`email_prefs.next_digest_at`, advanced in the same transaction that queues the digest, so a restart never sends two; one missed while the server was down goes out once, late) and never inside quiet hours. Muted boards and calendars (`email_mutes`) are skipped when mail is queued and again when it is sent. The provider gets the outbox row id as its idempotency key, so a retry cannot send twice. Timeouts and 5xx answers retry after 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 2 h, and 6 h, then the row is **dead**; a 4xx validation error is dead at once. Admins see all of this, with ids and statuses only, in **Team → Email log** (`/settings/team/email`), where a dead email can be retried.

Limits: per account address 20 an hour, per bare address (invites) 5 an hour, 20 an hour per sender, and `MAIL_DAILY_LIMIT` a day per instance (in memory, provider-facing); durably from the outbox, 12 activity emails an hour and 60 a day per person and 10 security emails an hour per person (held, not dropped, when full), and 10% of the instance's day kept for security and account mail. A 10 second timeout per send. Logs show the template, a hashed recipient, and Resend's message id (or, for a failure, Resend's error name and HTTP status), never the address, subject, body, token, or key. The Resend SDK's own error logging is switched off: outside `NODE_ENV=production` it would print the provider's whole error body, which can quote the address. A provider outage never blocks the main action; the admin can still copy an invite link. An invite email goes only to the address the invite is bound to. Outbox history is deleted after 30 days (sent, skipped) or 90 days (failed, dead); payloads are cleared as soon as a row is sent or skipped.

Unsubscribe: activity, reminder, and digest mail carries `List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post` (RFC 8058) headers and a footer link. Each link is HMAC-signed with `mail-signing.key` in the data directory (created on first use, 0600; it is in the backup with the rest of the data directory) and can only turn one email type (or the digest) off. Security mail cannot be turned off.

#### Bounces and complaints (optional Resend webhook)

Without a webhook Resend still keeps its own suppression list, so dead addresses are not mailed forever; the webhook lets Nook stop earlier and show people why. It is a **public, unauthenticated** endpoint, so it is off unless you set its secret, and a Nook reachable only on a tailnet can simply leave it off.

1. In the Resend dashboard, **Webhooks → Add endpoint**: URL `APP_ORIGIN/api/mail/webhook` (for example `https://nook.example.com/api/mail/webhook`; it must be reachable from the internet). Select the events `email.bounced`, `email.complained`, `email.suppressed`, and `email.failed`. Other events are accepted and ignored: Nook does no delivery or open tracking.
2. Copy the endpoint's **signing secret** (`whsec_…`) into `.env` as `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and restart. Without it the endpoint answers 404.
3. Keep click and open tracking off (above); the webhook needs neither.

Each delivery is verified with Resend's SDK (`webhooks.verify`, the Svix / Standard Webhooks scheme: `svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, `svix-signature`, HMAC-SHA256 over `id.timestamp.body`) on the **raw** request body, with a 5-minute timestamp tolerance and a 64 KiB body cap. A bad signature is 401 and stores nothing. The `svix-id` is recorded in `mail_webhook_events` (kept 7 days), so a replayed delivery is a no-op. A hard bounce, a complaint, or a Resend suppression stores the address's SHA-256 in `mail_suppressions`: Nook then sends only security mail to it, until the person presses **Try again** in Settings → Notifications (once a day, audited as `mail.suppression_cleared`). Soft (transient) bounces only count (`mail_soft_bounces`): three within 7 days pause non-security mail for 3 days, then it resumes by itself. Nothing from the payload is logged or kept beyond the event id and the address hash; `email.failed` marks the outbox row failed. Team → Email log tags recipients whose address is held back. Rotating the secret in Resend: update `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and restart.

Development: `MAIL_TRANSPORT=file` with an absolute `MAIL_FILE_PATH` writes every message to that JSON file instead of sending it, and `/dev/mail/preview` renders every template with sample data. Both exist only outside production (`NODE_ENV=production` refuses the file transport at startup and answers 404 for `/dev/*`).

### Static files and caching

Nothing to configure. The production server sends the app's content-hashed files (`/assets/*`) with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`: a browser keeps them until a release changes their names. Everything else it serves from `dist/` (the app page, `sw.js`, the web app manifest, icons) is `Cache-Control: no-cache` with an ETag (a hash of the file's bytes) and Last-Modified, so a new release is picked up on the next load and an unchanged page costs a 304. The build writes Brotli (`.br`) and gzip (`.gz`) copies of text files next to them (about 1 MB more in the image); the server sends one when the browser accepts it, with `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, and never compresses images or fonts. API responses stay `no-store`, and files, previews, and downloads keep their own private rules. A reverse proxy in front (Tailscale Serve, Caddy, nginx) may compress too; it sees already-compressed static files and passes them through. A tab left open across a release reloads itself once if it asks for a piece of the old release that is gone. Dotfiles and anything reached through a symlink leading out of `dist/` are never served; a missing file with an extension (`/favicon.ico`) is a plain 404, and `/robots.txt` asks every crawler to stay out (Nook is private).

## Configuration

Compose passes these variables from `.env` (see `.env.example`). Invalid values stop the server at startup with a message naming the variable.

| Variable | Default | Purpose and validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MYNOTES_DATA_DIR` | `/srv/mynotes` | Host directory Compose mounts at `/data`. Must be writable by UID 1000. Used by Compose and `scripts/backup.sh`, not by the server. |
| `PORT` | `2026` | Port the server listens on inside the container. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Data root inside the container. Leave unchanged under Compose. |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:2026` | Primary browser origin; the fallback for `APP_ORIGINS`. |
| `APP_ORIGINS` | `APP_ORIGIN` | Comma-separated exact `http(s)` origins accepted for sign-in, mutations, and MCP host checks. Entries with a path, credentials, query, or fragment are rejected. |
| `APP_NAME` | `Nook` | The name people see: tab titles, the sign-in page, link previews (`<title>`, `og:title`, `og:site_name`, `twitter:title`), the installed app's name (manifest `name`; `short_name` is its first 12 characters or first word), mail subjects, sender name when `MAIL_FROM` is a bare address, and footers, the authenticator app entry, and the MCP server title. One line of 1 to 40 characters without `<`, `>`, or control characters; the server logs the name it uses at startup. The social preview image, internal ids, and product terms such as "Nook keys" do not change. |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `true` (Compose and production) | `true` or `false`. Plain-HTTP access needs `false`. |
| `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` | `false` | `true` allows additional accounts; the first account is always allowed on an empty database. Team invites work with `false` (see *Invites instead of ALLOW_REGISTRATION*). |
| `ALLOWED_EMAILS` | empty | Comma-separated allowlist for registration, sign-in, and existing sessions. Empty allows any address. |
| `SIGNUP_ROLE` | `guest` | Team role of accounts registered after the first: `guest`, `viewer`, or `member` (never `admin`). |
| `TOTP_POLICY` | `optional` | `optional` or `required`. |
| `AUTH_METHODS` | `password` | Sign-in methods: `password`, `google`, or `both`. Enforced on the server (see *Google sign-in*). |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | empty | OAuth client ID from Google Cloud Console. Required when `AUTH_METHODS` is `google` or `both`. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | empty | OAuth client secret. Required when `AUTH_METHODS` is `google` or `both`. Never logged. |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` | `0` | Reverse proxies in front of Nook that add `X-Forwarded-For` (integer 0–5). `0` uses the connection's address; `N` takes the N-th entry from the right. Used for rate limits, logs, and API keys limited to addresses. Set `1` for one reverse proxy (check Tailscale Serve first); never set it without that many proxies in front, and publish the port on localhost behind a proxy (see *Rate limits and reverse proxies*). |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_ADDRESSES` | empty | The proxies' own addresses or CIDR ranges, comma-separated (for example `127.0.0.1,172.16.0.0/12`). When set, `X-Forwarded-For` is read only from connections coming from these addresses; anyone reaching Nook's port directly is seen as themselves. Empty: the header is trusted from any connection (a startup warning says so). Checked at startup. |
| `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | empty | Comma-separated email domains allowed to sign in or be created with Google (the Workspace `hd` claim must match). Empty allows any verified Google address. |
| `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | empty | Base64-encoded 32-byte key. Required when `TOTP_POLICY=required`. |
| `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | empty | The Vault's key: base64 of 32 bytes (`openssl rand -base64 32`), different from `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Empty keeps the Vault off. Keep it away from the backup location (see *Vault*). Never logged. |
| `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` | empty | Instead of `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: the absolute path of a file holding the key (a Docker secret or a root-only file), outside `DATA_DIR`. Setting both refuses to start. |
| `SESSION_DAYS` | `14` | Session lifetime in days, at least 1. |
| `MAX_MARKDOWN_BYTES` | `2000000` | Largest note body, at least 1024 bytes. |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `104857600` (100 MiB) | Largest single file. Integer from `1048576` (1 MiB) to `2147483648` (2 GiB). Bun's request body cap is this (or 2.1 MB, whichever is larger) plus 1 MiB; JSON bodies stay limited to 2.1 MB. |
| `USER_STORAGE_QUOTA_BYTES` | `10737418240` (10 GiB) | Document bytes per user, including documents in the Bin. Integer ≥ 0; `0` means unlimited. |
| `MIN_FREE_DISK_BYTES` | `1073741824` (1 GiB) | Uploads are refused when they would leave less free space than this on the data volume. Integer ≥ 0. |
| `PUSH_ENABLED` | `auto` | Web Push for calendar reminders: `auto` (on only when `APP_ORIGIN` is `https:`), `true`, or `false`. Browsers allow push only on a secure origin, so on `http://localhost` or a LAN address reminders appear in the bell and the notifications list only. |
| `PUSH_SUBJECT` | `APP_ORIGIN` | The VAPID contact push services may use: an `http(s)` URL or a `mailto:` address. |
| `PUSH_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` | empty | Extra push-service hosts, comma-separated (`push.example.com` or `*.push.example.com`), besides the built-in `*.googleapis.com`, `*.push.services.mozilla.com`, `*.push.apple.com`, and `*.notify.windows.com`. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | empty | Resend API key for outbound email (a single token without spaces). Email is on only when this and `MAIL_FROM` are both set. Never logged. |
| `MAIL_FROM` | empty | Sender, `nook@example.com` or `Nook <nook@example.com>`, on a domain verified in Resend. The display name may not contain `@`, `<`, `>`, or quotes. Anything else stops the server at startup. |
| `MAIL_INSTANCE_NAME` | the `APP_ORIGIN` host | Shown in every mail's header band and footer, so people with two Nooks can tell them apart. One line of at most 40 characters. |
| `MAIL_DAILY_LIMIT` | `500` | Messages a day for the whole instance, 1–10000. Set it to your Resend plan (100 on the free tier). 10% is kept for security and account mail. |
| `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | empty | The `whsec_…` signing secret of a Resend webhook pointed at `APP_ORIGIN/api/mail/webhook`, for bounces and spam complaints. Empty keeps the endpoint off (404). |
| `MAIL_ALLOW_HTTP_LINKS` | `false` | `true` lets mail go out when `APP_ORIGIN` is a non-localhost `http://` address (LAN or Tailscale without HTTPS). Links in mail are then unencrypted. |
| `MAIL_TRANSPORT` | `resend` | `resend`, or `file` for development and tests only (refused when `NODE_ENV=production`). |
| `MAIL_FILE_PATH` | empty | With `MAIL_TRANSPORT=file`: the absolute path of the JSON file messages are written to. |
| `GOOGLE_OIDC_TEST_BASE_URL` | empty | Tests and local QA only: a fake Google issuer (`tests/support/fakeGoogle.ts`). Refused when `NODE_ENV=production`. |
| `APP_VERSION` | `0.25.0` | Build metadata shown in Settings → About and reported by the MCP server. |
| `GIT_SHA` | `development` | Commit shown in Settings → About (first 40 characters). |

Fixed limits that are not configurable: 3 uploads in progress per user on the server (the app sends 2 at a time), 30-day Bin retention, 1 MiB text previews, 20 searches per 10 seconds per user, and an hourly sweeper.

## Storage

The container reads and writes `/data`, mapped by Compose to:

```text
/srv/mynotes
├── mynotes.sqlite (+ -wal, -shm)   metadata, accounts, sharing, version and search index
├── notes/<note-id>/
│   ├── current.md
│   ├── draft.md
│   └── versions/000001.md
├── documents/
│   ├── objects/<document-id>       uploaded file bytes, no extension
│   ├── objects/<object-id>         a whiteboard's current scene (a new object per save)
│   └── .staging/<document-id>.part uploads in progress (not backed up)
├── push/vapid.json                 Web Push signing keys (0600), created at first boot when push is on
├── server.heartbeat                rewritten every 5 s while the server runs (stale after 15 s)
└── backup/                         weekly archives (host backup script only)
```

Markdown files and documents are never exposed as static files; authenticated API handlers enforce access before reading them. File names live only in SQLite and are never used as paths. Uploads are streamed to `.staging` on the data volume (never to the container's small `/tmp`), and a sweeper removes abandoned staging files and orphaned objects at boot and hourly. A refused upload reports which limit applied. Notes and files in the Bin stay in place on disk until they are deleted forever.

The data directory is forced to mode `0700`; SQLite, WAL/SHM, and Markdown files use `0600`. The service refuses symlinked note directories and files.

**Single instance.** Only one Nook instance may use a data directory at a time: upload slots, per-document locks, rate limits, and the sweeper live in the process. Do not run a second container or a development server against the same directory. `server.heartbeat` lets host commands that need the server stopped (`vault-admin.ts rotate-kek`) refuse while one runs; it holds no secrets.

**Web Push.** Pushes carry no content: a push only wakes the device, whose service worker then fetches unread notifications from Nook with the user's session, so push services see timing only. Outbound requests go only to allowlisted push-service hosts over https on port 443, never to IP literals or private addresses, with no redirects and a 5-second timeout. Each user may register 10 devices; a device is removed when the push service reports it gone (404 or 410) and paused after 5 failed deliveries. `push/vapid.json` is included in backups. If it is lost, a new key pair is created at the next boot and each device must enable push again in Settings → Notifications.

**Whiteboards.** A whiteboard is a Files document whose bytes are its current scene, a canonical `.excalidraw` JSON object of at most 4 MiB under `documents/objects/<object-id>`. Each save writes a new object and removes the old one after the database switches to it; a crash in between leaves an orphan that the hourly sweeper removes after an hour. Boards count against the owner's quota like any file, together with their kept previous versions and their thumbnails (at most 128 KiB each, stored in SQLite). The Excalidraw editor and its self-hosted fonts add about 21 MB to the image's `dist/`, about 26 MB with the compressed copies Nook serves (fonts about 13 MB, of which the Xiaolai CJK font is about 12.7 MB); the editor is downloaded by a browser only when someone opens a board.

**Whiteboard safety snapshots.** The `whiteboard_snapshots` table (created by migration 030) is in use since whiteboards shipped: a save that empties a board, or takes a board of 10 or more elements to fewer than half of them, keeps the scene it replaces as a snapshot, and **Restore previous version** keeps the scene it replaces too; at most 5 are kept per board, only the owner sees and restores them, and they count toward the owner's quota.

**Whiteboard pictures, versions, and imports (Wave 24, no migration).** A picture on a board is an ordinary File (uploaded into the board's folder, or picked from Files); the scene holds only its document id, so pictures count toward the quota once and are backed up, binned, and purged as files. Browsers load pictures through the normal content route with the viewer's own session; the server never reads a picture for a board. Each board keeps up to 20 earlier versions (`whiteboard_snapshots`: one every 30 minutes of drawing, plus one whenever a board is emptied or mostly cleared); each is a full scene object counted toward the owner's quota and purged with the board. Imports of `.excalidraw` files take a request of at most 32 MiB; every embedded picture goes through the upload pipeline (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, the content sniff, the quota), and a failed import removes the pictures it stored. The CSP is unchanged: pictures are scaled for display with canvas APIs, and Excalidraw's WebAssembly-based resizer is never used (its image tool opens Nook's own picker; the build fails if that patch stops applying).

**EXIF and embedded metadata.** Nook stores uploaded files byte for byte and does not strip EXIF or other embedded metadata (for example GPS location or author) from images or PDFs. Tell users to remove it before uploading files they plan to share.

## Backup and restore

Run the host-side backup script once a week:

```sh
./scripts/backup.sh
```

It briefly stops a running app container so the SQLite database, Markdown files, and documents are captured at the same point in time, writes a verified gzip archive under `/srv/mynotes/backup` (or your configured data directory), keeps the newest five archives, and starts the app again. A second run within seven days is skipped; use `./scripts/backup.sh --force` only when you intentionally want an extra snapshot.

For unattended weekly execution, add this entry with `crontab -e` (Sunday at 03:00):

```cron
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/nook && ./scripts/backup.sh >> /srv/mynotes/backup/backup.log 2>&1
```

To restore, stop Nook, extract an archive into an empty data directory, point `MYNOTES_DATA_DIR` at that directory if it differs from the default, and start the service:

```sh
mkdir -p /srv/mynotes-restored
tar -xzf /srv/mynotes/backup/mynotes-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.tar.gz \
  -C /srv/mynotes-restored
MYNOTES_DATA_DIR=/srv/mynotes-restored docker compose up -d --build
```

The archive contains the data directory contents at its root, so no path rearrangement is required. Keep the same `.env` (in particular `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) when starting the restored copy, and start only one instance per data directory.

- Archives include `documents/objects` but not `documents/.staging`. Archive size and the time the app is stopped grow with the stored files (gzip gains little on already-compressed media), and five archives multiply that disk use.
- Items in the Bin are included like live ones. A note or file deleted forever (or expired from the Bin) can survive in older archives for up to about five weeks, until those archives rotate out.
- The backup intentionally does not include `.env`. Store it securely alongside your backups, especially `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, which is required to use restored TOTP enrollments. **The exception is `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`:** keep it somewhere other than the backups, because an archive together with that key reveals every vault secret, and a restore needs the same key (see *Vault*). Vault values are in the archive only as ciphertext.

## Upgrades

```sh
./scripts/backup.sh --force
git pull --ff-only
APP_VERSION=<release> GIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:2026/api/health
```

Every image carries immutable numbered migrations under `server/migrations`. They run transactionally and are recorded in SQLite's `schema_migrations` table before the HTTP server accepts requests. New schema changes are always added as a new migration; released migrations are never edited.

**Upgrading to 0.25.0:** no migration. One new optional setting, `APP_NAME` (1–40 characters; the served page, manifest, mail, and the app use it; unset keeps "Nook"); `compose.yaml` passes it through, so add it to `.env` and restart. The Bin moved into Settings (`/settings/bin`; `/bin` still works) and the Bin and Team buttons left the top bar. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.25.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.24.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 038 (vault keys: `mcp_api_keys.vault_protected_access`, `api_key_grants.protected_at_grant`, `vault_events.key_name`/`key_prefix`, an index, and triggers that keep vault grants only on vault keys owned by people) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds. No new environment variables. Existing general keys are unchanged and still cannot reach the Vault. See *Vault* for what a leaked `nkv_` key can do and how to revoke it. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.24.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.23.0:** no migration and no new settings. Settings is a full page at `/settings/...` that also holds every Team screen; `/team/...` links (including the ones in emails) keep working as aliases. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.23.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.22.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 037 (vault sharing: `sessions.vault_reauth_at`, `vaults.stored_bytes` with a backfill, `target_id` and `level` on `vault_events`, an index on secrets, and a trigger that refuses integrations as vault members) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds. No new environment variables. Data-key rotations run inside the server in batches and resume after a restart. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.22.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.21.0:** no migration and no new settings; connected whiteboards (pictures from Files, links, note cards, History, duplicate, import) only add routes. Pictures uploaded from a board or imported are stored as Files in the board's folder and take that folder's sharing. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.21.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.20.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 031 (the Vault's tables) runs once on the first boot; it only adds tables, and its number is lower than 032–035, which your instance already applied (expected: each migration is applied by its own number). The Vault stays off until you set `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE` (see *Vault*); nothing else changes. From this release SQLite runs with `secure_delete` on, which makes deletes a little slower and overwrites deleted rows.

**Upgrading to 0.19.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 036 (integrations: a `description` and a `retired_at` marker on accounts, and database triggers that refuse a session, a Google identity, an admin or guest role, or a kind change for an integration) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds; nothing about existing people or keys changes. Migration number 031 is still intentionally unused. No new environment variables are needed. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.19.0`, and restart as above.

What an admin should know:

- **Team → Integrations** creates accounts for AI clients and scripts (role member or viewer) that never sign in; admins create, rotate, narrow, and revoke their keys there with their own password, and Team → Keys lists those keys with the integration as owner. An integration reaches only what owners share with it by name (never "everyone signed in", never through a group), and the Access sheet tells owners that admins hold its keys. Integrations receive no email or bell notifications and cannot be invited, promoted to admin, or added to groups.
- **Deleting an integration** revokes its keys; the account is removed only when it never had a key and created nothing, otherwise it is kept as "Deleted (kept for attribution)" and can never be unblocked or re-keyed. `team-admin list` marks integrations; the other `team-admin` commands refuse them.
- **REST and MCP:** `GET /api/v1/me` reports `owner.kind` (`person` or `service`). No MCP tool creates or manages integrations or keys.

**Upgrading to 0.18.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 033 (key use per surface: when each API key was last used over MCP and over REST, a new daily usage table split by surface, and the columns that record a key's last refused call; existing use is copied as MCP use) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds; nothing existing changes. Its number is lower than migrations 034 and 035, which your instance already applied: that is expected, because the app applies each migration by its own number. Migration number 031 is intentionally not used yet. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.18.0`, and restart as above.

What an admin should know:

- **One new optional variable, `TRUSTED_PROXY_ADDRESSES`:** the addresses or CIDR ranges your reverse proxy connects from, comma-separated (for example `127.0.0.1` for a proxy on the same host, or `172.16.0.0/12` for a proxy container on the Docker network). When set, `X-Forwarded-For` is read only from those proxies, and anyone reaching Nook's port directly is seen as their own address. Set it as soon as `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` is 1 or more. If `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` is set without it, Nook logs a warning at startup and trusts the header from any connection, so the port must then be reachable only through the proxy: publish it on localhost only (`"127.0.0.1:2026:2026"` in `compose.yaml`, shown there as a comment) or firewall it. See [Rate limits and reverse proxies](#rate-limits-and-reverse-proxies). No other new variables.
- **Existing keys:** unchanged. They stay MCP-only with no address limit, and there is nothing to do. New keys use MCP unless their creator also picks REST.
- **REST API:** keys whose surfaces include REST call the same tools as MCP at `/api/v1` (see [The REST API](#the-rest-api-apiv1)). A reverse proxy that already passes `/api` needs no change. **Team → Policies** now applies its REST and MCP role lists (`rest_roles`, default admins and members; `mcp_roles`, default admins, members, and viewers).
- **Keys limited to chosen items and addresses:** keys can be limited to chosen items in every module, and, only when `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` is 1 or more, to up to ten addresses or ranges. Refused calls show on the owner's key row and in its **Recent activity** section with a shortened address, and in Team → Access activity without the address. Rotating a key asks for the password and can now change its access, surfaces, and addresses; Edit can only narrow (including from all items to chosen ones).
- **Team → Keys** shows each key's use per surface per day, and filters by surface and by address limit.
- **Behaviour changes for developers using MCP:** invalid arguments now name the argument on every tool (`"cardId: Invalid UUID"`); the `Bearer` scheme is accepted in any letter case; every key that does not authenticate (unknown, mistyped, expired, past its rotation grace, or revoked) answers 401 with the one code `KEY_INVALID`, and the reason is shown only to the key's owner; `/api/v1` refuses a key sent in a URL (`KEY_IN_URL`); every refusal of `PUT /mcp/uploads/:id` now carries a code, including `UPLOAD_NOT_FOUND`, `UPLOAD_CONFLICT`, and `UPLOAD_FAILED`. There are no new MCP tools, and no tool on either surface deletes forever, shares, or manages keys.
- **Not in this release:** service accounts.

The web API gains `grants[].resources`, `surfaces`, and `ipAllowlist` on `POST /api/keys`, narrowing of `surfaces` and `ipAllowlist` on `PATCH /api/keys/:id`, and `grants`, `surfaces`, and `ipAllowlist` on `POST /api/keys/:id/rotate`; `GET /api/keys` adds per-surface last use and daily counts and the last refused call, and `GET /api/team/keys` accepts `?surface=` and `?ipRestricted=`.

**Upgrading to 0.17.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 030 (whiteboards: the `whiteboards` table, one row per board next to its Files entry; `whiteboard_snapshots`, the kept previous versions; and `whiteboard_search` with the full-text index `whiteboard_fts`) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds; nothing existing changes. Its number is lower than migrations your instance already applied (032, 034, and 035): that is expected, because the app applies each migration by its own number. Migration numbers 031 and 033 are intentionally not used yet. No new environment variables are needed. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.17.0`, and restart as above.

What an admin should know:

- **Image size and page loads:** the Docker image grows by about 26 MB: the editor's fonts (about 13 MB, of which the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean handwriting font is about 12.7 MB), the canvas code, and the compressed copies Nook serves. People who never open a whiteboard download nothing extra; the first board someone opens downloads the canvas, about 266 KB compressed in our measurement, and fonts as needed. Nothing is fetched from other sites, and the content security policy is unchanged.
- **Disk use:** boards, their kept previous versions (at most five per board), and their thumbnails count toward each person's storage quota like any file. A board's scene is at most 4 MiB.
- **The new dependency:** `@excalidraw/excalidraw` 0.18.1 (MIT licence), pinned to that exact version. It is used at build time and shipped inside the app bundle, so the production image's `node_modules` does not carry it. The build patches a few places in it (self-hosted fonts instead of a font CDN, and no copy-as-SVG), and the build fails if a patch stops applying, so upgrading it is a deliberate step. Building from source needs network access to the package registry, as before.
- **Turning it off:** each person can turn Whiteboards off in Settings → Modules (on by default); that hides the app, its Today section, and the **Open whiteboard** action in Files for them, and their boards still appear in Files as `.excalidraw` downloads. There is no instance-wide switch.
- **API keys:** there are two new key permissions, **Read whiteboards** (`whiteboards:read`) and **Create whiteboards** (`whiteboards:write`, which only creates empty, private boards), and a key can be limited to chosen boards. Existing keys gain nothing. If an admin ever changed the modules for a role's keys in **Team → Policies**, the saved list does not include Whiteboards: tick it there before that role's keys can use whiteboards. If those lists were never changed, the defaults include it.
- **MCP:** new tools `list_whiteboards` (which can also search board names and text), `read_whiteboard`, and `create_whiteboard`. No tool edits, deletes, or shares a board.
- **Limits:** per person per minute, 120 saves, 30 thumbnails, and 30 new boards (past them the app waits and retries). A scene may hold at most 5,000 shapes, 10,000 points per shape and 200,000 per board, and 20,000 characters per text and 1 MiB of text per board.
- **Not in this release:** images on the canvas, links from shapes to Nook items, embedding a board in a note, a full version history, importing `.excalidraw` files as boards (an uploaded one stays an ordinary file), SVG export, and a whiteboards filter in the Search screen.

The web API gains `/api/whiteboards` (create and list), `/api/whiteboards/:id` (read), `/api/whiteboards/:id/scene` (save), `/api/whiteboards/:id/thumbnail`, `/api/whiteboards/:id/previous-version`, and `/api/whiteboards/:id/restore-previous`; Files and Bin summaries gain `kind` (`"file"` or `"whiteboard"`), and `GET /api/search` accepts `scope=whiteboards`.

**Upgrading to 0.16.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 035 (the Today digest offer: one new nullable column, `email_prefs.digest_prompt_at`, recording when a person answered or dismissed the offer) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds; nobody's email settings change by upgrading. Migration numbers 030, 031, and 033 are intentionally not used yet: they belong to features that ship later, and the app applies each migration by its own number, so the gap is expected. No new environment variables are needed. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.16.0`, and restart as above.

What an admin should know:

- **Caching and compression:** Nook now caches and compresses its own static files (see [Static files and caching](#static-files-and-caching)); there is nothing to configure. A reverse proxy in front that also compresses is fine: it passes the already-compressed files through. After the upgrade, browsers pick up the new version on the next page load, and a tab left open across the upgrade reloads itself once if needed.
- **API keys page moved:** Settings → API keys is now `/settings/keys`. Old `/settings/mcp` links and bookmarks still open it, and the new-key and password-changed emails link to the new address.
- **Keys without an expiry:** creating or rotating a key can now choose **No expiry**, unless **Team → Policies** requires an expiry. That policy already blocked keys without an expiry before this release; what is new is that such keys can be created on purpose, and that a blocked key's row now says "Blocked by team policy: keys need an expiry. Rotate it to give it one." Blocked keys are not revoked: rotating one gives its holder a replacement with an expiry, and turning the policy off unblocks it.
- **Missing files answer 404:** a request for a file that does not exist and whose name has an extension (for example `/favicon.ico`; Nook ships `/favicon.svg`) now gets a plain 404 instead of the app page with 200. Adjust any uptime check that probed such a path and expected 200; use `/api/health` instead. Addresses without an extension still open the app, and `/robots.txt` now asks crawlers to stay out.
- **Today digest offer:** people with email on, a verified address, and an account at least 7 days old are asked once on Today whether they want the email digest. Viewers and guests can answer it too; answering changes only their own email settings.

The web API gains `GET` and `POST /api/mail/digest-prompt` (the offer's visibility, and the answer `{ "choice": "daily" | "weekly" | "dismiss" }`), and `POST /api/keys` and `POST /api/keys/:id/rotate` accept `"expiresInDays": null` for a key with no expiry (refused with 403 `KEY_POLICY` when the team policy requires an expiry). There are no new MCP tools.

**Upgrading to 0.15.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 034 (Google identities: the `google_identities` table linking a Google account to a Nook account, the `google_auth_flows` table for sign-ins in progress, and new columns for the profile picture (`users.avatar_id`), a session's last Google confirmation (`sessions.reauth_at`), an admin's link allowance, the one-time reset notice, and the last refused Google sign-in) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds; no account changes by upgrading. Migration numbers 030, 031, and 033 are intentionally not used yet: they belong to features that ship later, and the app applies each migration by its own number, so the gap is expected. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.15.0`, and restart as above.

**Nothing changes for sign-in until you set `AUTH_METHODS`.** The default is `password`, which keeps sign-in exactly as before and turns Google off. `both` offers email and password and Google; `google` turns off password sign-in, registration with a password, forgot and reset password, and password change. New variables (all optional; see [Configuration](#configuration)): `AUTH_METHODS` (`password`), `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (empty; both required for `google` or `both`, or the server refuses to start), `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` (empty), and `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` (`0`, at most 5). Compose passes them through from `.env`, and `.env.example` lists them.

To turn on Google sign-in (details in [Google sign-in](#google-sign-in)):

1. In the Google Cloud console, open *APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen* and choose **Internal** for a Google Workspace organisation (**External** otherwise).
2. Create an OAuth client of type **Web application** and add exactly one authorised redirect URI: `APP_ORIGIN/api/auth/google/callback`, for example `https://notes.example.com/api/auth/google/callback`. It must match `APP_ORIGIN` character for character.
3. In `.env`, set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_METHODS=both` (or `google`), then restart.

- **Company deployments:** set `GOOGLE_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=example.com`. It restricts Google sign-in only, not password registration, so if only company accounts should exist use `AUTH_METHODS=google` or keep `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false`. The first account on an empty instance becomes the admin: sign in yourself before you share the address.
- **Behind a reverse proxy:** set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` to the number of proxies in front of Nook (`1` for one), and publish the port on localhost only (`127.0.0.1:<host-port>:2026`) or firewall it, because anyone who can reach the app's port directly could otherwise forge their address. With the default `0` behind a proxy, every visitor shares one address for the per-address limits. Never set it above `0` without a proxy in front. See *Rate limits and reverse proxies* under [Google sign-in](#google-sign-in).
- **New per-address limits:** password sign-in (20 a minute per client address), account creation (5), and invite link preview (10) are now limited per client address as well as per email (10 password sign-ins) and for the whole instance (120, 20, and 60).
- **Switching to `AUTH_METHODS=google`:** accounts that have only a password cannot sign in until they are linked. Link them first in `both` mode (**Settings → Security → Link Google**), or use an admin's allowance in **Team** or the host command line.
- **With email off**, no address is ever verified in Nook, so a Google sign-in never links an existing account by itself: existing accounts link through **Settings** (in `both` mode) or through an admin's allowance.
- **Lockout:** the host command line works in every `AUTH_METHODS` mode: `docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts allow-google-link user@example.com [--reset | --keep-credentials]`, `unlink-google user@example.com`, `set-role`, and `unblock`. If Google sign-in breaks, set `AUTH_METHODS=both` or `password` and restart.

New admin powers (see [Google sign-in](#google-sign-in) above), each asking for the admin's own password (or a Google confirmation) and two-factor code, recorded in **Team → Access activity**, and told to the member on the bell and, with email on, by security mail:

- **Allow Google sign-in:** the next Google sign-in with the member's address links the account, once, within 24 hours, and only from a Google account that Google confirms manages the address.
- **Reset account for Google sign-in:** signs the account out everywhere, revokes its API keys and calendar feed links and unused password-reset links, removes its password and two-factor setup, makes everything it owns private and removes every person and group it shared with, revokes its open invites, and pauses its routines. Content is kept. In the app it is offered only for accounts whose address was never verified, never for admins or accounts that were admins in the last 24 hours, and never for your own account; the command line's `--reset` can. The member also sees a one-time notice at their next sign-in.
- **Allow re-linking:** for a linked account whose owner recreated their Google account. When the new Google account signs in, the previous holder's sessions, push subscriptions, API keys, calendar feed links, and unused password-reset links end, and by default the password and two-factor are removed too.
- **Unlink:** removes the member's Google account and signs them out everywhere.

Accounts that sign in only with Google have no password: where Nook asks for a password to confirm a change (a new API key, rotating a key, two-factor setup), they choose **Confirm with Google**, which needs a fresh Google sign-in. Google profile pictures are stored in `avatars/` in the data directory and included in backups. After turning on two-factor, Settings now stays open on the recovery codes until **I saved them**.

The web API gains the `/api/auth/google/*` routes (start, callback, second factor, invite, cancel, link, and `DELETE /api/auth/google` to unlink), `/api/team/:userId/google` (Google sign-in state, allow, and unlink for admins), and `/api/users/:id/avatar`; `/api/about` reports `authMethods`. There are no new MCP tools, and API keys are unaffected.

**Upgrading to 0.14.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 032 (central access: the table behind access notices on the bell, the snapshot of an access template stored on each invite, and an index for the Access activity page) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It only adds; nobody's access changes by upgrading. Migration numbers 030 and 031 are intentionally not used yet: they belong to features that ship later, and the app applies each migration by its own number, so the gap is expected and those migrations will run on a later upgrade. No new environment variables are needed. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.14.0`, and restart as above.

New admin powers (see [Central access management](#central-access-management) above):

- **See:** admins can now see what each member can reach, per kind and through what (shared directly, through a group, or with everyone signed in), plus their groups and API keys. Items the admin cannot open are listed without their title, and admins still cannot open those items.
- **Reduce:** admins can lower a level, remove a direct share, take a person out of a group, or **Reset access** (direct shares, group memberships, API keys, and calendar feeds removed or revoked, routines paused; items the person owns stay). Each asks for confirmation and is recorded in **Team → Access activity**.
- **Not grant:** nothing on the member's Access page grants or raises access.
- **Owners are told:** the owner gets a line on the bell when an admin lowers or removes someone's access to their items, or resets that person's access.
- **Templates:** **Team → Templates** gives an invite a role and groups; the invite keeps the template as it was when the invite was made.

The web API gains `/api/team/members/:id/access` (member access, reductions, and reset), `/api/team/templates` (access templates), `/api/team/activity` (access activity), and `/api/me/access` (your own access, for every role but guest); `POST /api/team/invites` accepts `templateId`. There are no new MCP tools, and API keys cannot manage access.

**Upgrading to 0.13.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 029 (access levels) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. It keeps existing collection and calendar editors editing: people shared with as editors keep the edit level. Existing board members become editors, as before. Nobody becomes a manager by upgrading; only an owner can make one. API keys gain no new powers from this release. No new environment variables are needed. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.13.0`, and restart as above.

Powers that moved from the owner to managers (the web API answers 403 `MANAGER_REQUIRED` to everyone else):

- **Boards:** rename the board and change its structure settings (levels, sprints on or off, sprint defaults); add, rename, and reorder columns, set a column's state (including done) and WIP limit, and delete empty columns; rename, recolour, and delete tags; create, edit, start, complete, and delete sprints.
- **Collections:** rename and change the icon; edit fields; create, edit, and delete saved views.
- **Calendars:** rename and change colour.
- **Boards, collections, and calendars:** open the Access sheet and share with people and groups up to the edit level.
- **Still the owner's alone:** deleting the item, the Bin and deleting forever, the older audience-wide sharing routes, changing the audience or its level, and adding, changing, or removing managers.
- **Unchanged:** collection CSV import stays at the edit level.
- **Narrowed:** creating a board tag now needs the edit level (it used to need only read access).

A client or script that matched the error code `OWNER_ONLY` for these structure refusals now receives `MANAGER_REQUIRED` on the web API; MCP still reports `OWNER_ONLY`. Through an API key, board structure tools (renaming and recolouring tags, WIP limits, creating and starting sprints) stay with the board's owner: a manager's key is refused. `/api/about` gained `passwordReset` (whether **Forgot password?** can send a link) and `twoFactor` (whether two-factor can be set up on this instance).

**Upgrading to 0.12.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migrations 025 (access keys, grants and policies) and 028 (email digests, bounce tracking and share log) run once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. Existing MCP keys are converted to grants with the same reach; nothing widens. They have no expiry and show **No expiry**; a team policy that requires an expiry blocks them until they get one or the rule is loosened. Migration 025 also creates the tables later access waves use (groups, per-person levels, templates) with defaults that change nothing, and `/api/mcp/keys` keeps working for one release as an alias of `/api/keys`. Bounce and complaint handling is optional: add `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to `.env` and point a Resend webhook at `/api/mail/webhook` (see [Bounces and complaints](#bounces-and-complaints-optional-resend-webhook) above); without it the endpoint returns 404. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.12.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.11.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migration 026 (outbound email) runs once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup; migration 027 (proposal base) was already applied by 0.10.0. Email is optional: set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` in `.env` (see [Email (Resend)](#email-resend) above); without them, all email stays off and the app behaves as before. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.11.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.10.0:** back up first with `./scripts/backup.sh --force`. Migrations 018 (team invites), 021 (agent inbox), 022 (comment reactions), and 027 (proposal base) run once on the first boot and can only be undone by restoring that backup. Existing MCP-written note drafts are backfilled as proposals in the Inbox, so review them there. Email is optional: invite emails need `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` in `.env` (see [Email (Resend)](#email-resend) above); without them, share invite links yourself. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.10.0`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.9.3:** no migration; no backup needed beyond your usual schedule. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.9.3`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.9.2:** no migration; no backup needed beyond your usual schedule. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.9.2`, and restart as above. Sprint defaults are saved in the board's existing structure settings; if you roll back to an older build, a board saved with sprint defaults shows as **Flat** there until you upgrade again.

**Upgrading to 0.9.1:** no migration; no backup needed beyond your usual schedule. Pull, rebuild with `APP_VERSION=0.9.1`, and restart as above.

**Upgrading to 0.9.0:** back up first (`./scripts/backup.sh --force`, as above). Migration 019 (task hierarchy and sprints: card parents and levels, board structures, and the sprint table) runs once on the first boot, before the server accepts requests, and cannot be undone except by restoring that backup. It backfills nothing: every existing board stays flat and every existing card stays a top-level card, so boards look the same until an owner picks a structure. This release also adds `SIGNUP_ROLE`: accounts registered from now on get the **guest** role by default (they read only what is shared with them by name, and cannot create API keys). To keep the earlier behaviour, set `SIGNUP_ROLE=member` in `.env` before starting the new image; `viewer` is also accepted and `admin` is refused at startup. Existing accounts keep their roles. Viewer and guest accounts are read-only on the server for every app and MCP key (see [Team admins and blocking](#team-admins-and-blocking)).

**Upgrading to 0.8.1:** back up first (`./scripts/backup.sh --force`, as above). Migration 020 (board column states and saved task views) runs once on the first boot, before the server accepts requests, and cannot be undone except by restoring that backup. It gives every board column a workflow state: done columns become done, each board's first column becomes to-do, and the rest become in progress.

**Upgrading to 0.8.0:** back up first (`./scripts/backup.sh --force`, as above). Migrations 015 (task card due times, assignees, WIP limits, tags, flags, and relations), 016 (per-account preferences for Settings → Modules), and 017 (team roles and blocking) run once on the first boot, before the server accepts requests, and cannot be undone except by restoring that backup. Migration 017 makes the **oldest enabled account the admin** and everyone else a member; if that is wrong, fix it with `docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts set-role <email> admin`, and keep `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` until an active admin exists (see [Team admins and blocking](#team-admins-and-blocking)).

**Upgrading to 0.5.0:** migration 008 adds the search index tables, and the first boot fills them from the notes on disk before the server accepts requests, logging only counts (`Search index: N indexed, …`). Later boots only repair rows that are missing or stale. The index stores a plain-text copy of each note's published version and draft inside `mynotes.sqlite`, so it lives on the same disk and in the same backups as the notes themselves.

**Upgrading from 0.3.0 or earlier:** notes deleted before this version (which the old interface described as permanent) reappear in the Bin for 30 days after the upgrade, then are deleted automatically. Never-published notes deleted before the upgrade are removed on the first sweep. Empty the Bin, or delete those items forever, if you do not want to keep them for that window.

## Development

Development runs on the host with Bun (Compose only defines the production `app` service):

```sh
bun install
DATA_DIR=./data APP_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173 COOKIE_SECURE=false ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true bun run dev
bun run dev:client
```

`bun run dev` serves the API on port `2026` (stop the Docker container first, since it uses the same port) and restarts on changes. `bun run dev:client` starts Vite at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` to it. `./data` is ignored by Git. Run `bun run typecheck` and `bun test` before committing.
