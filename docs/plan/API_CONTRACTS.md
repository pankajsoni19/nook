# API contracts: Files, content, Bin, Search, Tasks, Today, Preferences, MCP, Collections, Calendar, and Team

Companion to [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](../../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md). Every endpoint lives under `/api` and inherits the existing middleware:

- a session cookie is required (401 otherwise)
- the `TOTP_POLICY=required` setup gate applies
- `Cache-Control: no-store`
- global security headers apply

Mutations (anything other than GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS) require:

- an allowed `Origin` (403)
- `X-CSRF-Token` (403)
- `Content-Type: application/json` (415). The single exception is `POST /api/files`, which requires `multipart/form-data`.

**Conventions**

- Errors are `{ "error": string, "code"?: string, "details"?: string[] }`. Zod failures return 400 `{ error: "Invalid request", details }`, as they do today.
- Ids are UUIDs, validated with `uuid.parse`. A malformed id returns 400.
- Missing, forbidden, and (for non-owners) binned items all return **404** with the same message.
- Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings (`new Date().toISOString()`).
- Field casing follows existing responses: snake_case for DB-shaped rows, camelCase for computed flags.

## Types

```ts
type Visibility = "private" | "selected" | "all_users";
type PreviewKind = "image" | "pdf" | "text" | "audio" | "video" | "none";

type DocumentSummary = {
  id: string;
  owner_id: string;
  owner_name: string;
  is_owner: 0 | 1;
  folder_id: string | null;      // masked to null for recipients unless the folder itself is visible to them
  name: string;
  mime_type: string;
  preview_kind: PreviewKind;
  size_bytes: number;
  visibility: Visibility;        // effective: folder visibility when inheriting, else document visibility
  sharing_override: 0 | 1;       // only meaningful to owners; recipients receive 0
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
};

type BinItem = {
  type: "note" | "document" | "card" | "board" | "collection" | "collection_row" | "calendar" | "event";   // collection types: Wave 11; calendar types: Wave 12
  id: string;
  title: string;                 // note title, document name, card title, or board name
  folder_id: string | null;      // original folder, null if it no longer exists
  folder_name: string | null;    // null → restore target is Default
  size_bytes: number | null;     // documents only
  deleted_at: string;
  purge_after: string;
  purging: boolean;              // purge_started_at IS NOT NULL
  board_id: string | null;       // cards: their board; boards: themselves; else null
  board_name: string | null;
  attachment: boolean;           // a document that was a card attachment (restores into Files)
  can_purge: boolean;            // false for a card, row, or event the caller deleted on someone else's board, collection, or calendar
};
```

`sha256`, `upload_key`, the storage path, and the deletion columns are **never** returned by list or metadata endpoints.

## Files

### Upload

`POST /api/files?folderId=<uuid>`. If `folderId` is omitted, the file goes to the caller's Default folder.

`purpose` (Wave 9, migration 009): every document has `documents.purpose` = `file` (default), `task_attachment`, or `collection_attachment` (reserved for Wave 11). The optional `?purpose=` parameter accepts `file` or `task_attachment`; anything else returns 400. A `task_attachment` upload takes no `folderId` (400 otherwise), is stored with `folder_id = NULL`, never appears in Files, counts toward the quota, and becomes readable to a board's readers only once linked to one of its cards (§ Tasks, Attachments).

The request body is `multipart/form-data` with **exactly one** part, named `file`. The part's `filename` parameter becomes the display name after sanitization (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN §6.4). The part's `Content-Type` is ignored for classification.

Optional headers:

- `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>`: the Files UI always sends one per queued file
- `Content-Length` is **required** (411 without it). Browsers send it for `FormData` and it enables the early 413

| Status | When | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 201 | Stored | `{ document: DocumentSummary }` |
| 200 | `Idempotency-Key` already used by this user | `{ document: DocumentSummary, idempotentReplay: true }` |
| 400 | Not multipart, missing or extra parts, a field other than `file`, a malformed boundary, or an invalid `folderId`/`Idempotency-Key` | `{ error }` |
| 404 | Folder not found or not owned by the caller | `{ error: "Folder not found" }` |
| 409 | `Idempotency-Key` was already used by this user for a document that is now in the Bin. Clients treat this as final and do not retry. | `{ error, code: "IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_USED" }` |
| 408 | No body bytes arrived for 30 seconds (the upload stalled) | `{ error, code: "UPLOAD_TIMEOUT" }` |
| 411 | `Content-Length` is missing or not a valid integer. Browsers always send it for `FormData` and `File` bodies. | `{ error, code: "LENGTH_REQUIRED" }` |
| 413 | `Content-Length` or streamed bytes exceed `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `{ error, code: "FILE_TOO_LARGE", limitBytes }` |
| 415 | `Content-Type` is not `multipart/form-data` | `{ error }` |
| 429 | The user already has 3 uploads in flight | `{ error, code: "TOO_MANY_UPLOADS" }` |
| 507 | The quota would be exceeded, or free disk would fall below `MIN_FREE_DISK_BYTES` | `{ error, code: "QUOTA_EXCEEDED" \| "DISK_FULL" }` |

Audit: `document.upload { documentId, size, mimeType }`. The filename is never logged or audited.

> **Implementation notes (shipped in v0.3.0):**
> - The early 413 uses `Content-Length > MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES + 64 KiB` (multipart overhead). Streamed bytes are still checked against `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` exactly.
> - Requests without `Content-Length` (chunked) are accepted and bounded while streaming; the quota and free-disk checks then reserve `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` for the request.
> - busboy is configured with `parts: 2` and `fileSize: MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES + 1`, because it reports a limit when a count or size *reaches* it. Reaching two parts is treated as an extra part (400); a file part over the limit fails at once (413) instead of draining the body.
> - 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_USED` is also returned when a concurrent upload with the same key commits first and that document is binned before the replay is read.
> - A huge chunked body sent to a non-upload route is stopped by Bun's global `maxRequestBodySize` with a bare 413, not the JSON error shape.

### List

`GET /api/files?folderId=<uuid>` lists live documents the caller can read, ordered by `updated_at DESC`, with a limit of 500. The `folderId` filter matches `documents.folder_id`. Only `purpose = 'file'` documents are listed: attachments never appear in Files, not even for their uploader, and they are left out of `GET /api/bin?type=document` (they still count toward the storage quota).

200 → `{ documents: DocumentSummary[] }`

### Metadata

`GET /api/files/:id` → 200 `{ document: DocumentSummary }`, or 404.

### Rename and move

`PATCH /api/files/:id` with body `{ name?: string, folderId?: uuid | null }`. The schema is strict, and at least one key must be present. Owner only.

- `name` is sanitized with the upload rules. If it is empty or longer than 255 UTF-8 bytes after sanitizing, the response is 400. Preview kind and MIME type **do not** change on rename.
- `folderId` must be a folder owned by the caller (404 `Folder not found` otherwise). `null` moves the document to no folder: private unless it has an override, and shown under All.
- 200 → `{ document: DocumentSummary }` with the new effective `visibility`, so the UI can report it.
- Audit: `document.rename { documentId }`, `document.move { documentId, folderId }`.

### Sharing

This mirrors the notes endpoints exactly.

- `GET /api/files/:id/sharing` (owner only) → `{ visibility: "inherit" | Visibility, users: [{ id, display_name }] }`
- `PUT /api/files/:id/sharing` with body `{ visibility: "inherit" | "private" | "selected" | "all_users", userIds: uuid[] (max 100) }`
  - The same validation as `sharingSchema`: the owner cannot be a recipient, `selected` requires at least one user, and every user must exist and be enabled.
  - It replaces the rows in `document_shares`. `inherit` sets `sharing_override = 0`.
  - 200 `{ ok: true }`
  - Audit: `document.sharing_changed { documentId, visibility, recipientCount }`

### Delete (to Bin)

`DELETE /api/files/:id` (owner only, body `{}`):

- **Live document:** sets `deleted_at = now`, `deleted_by = caller`, and `purge_after = now + 30 days` → 200 `{ ok: true, purgeAfter }`.
- **Already binned (owner):** 200 `{ ok: true, alreadyDeleted: true, purgeAfter }`.
- **Missing or not owned:** 404.
- Audit: `document.delete { documentId }`.

**Non-file documents (Wave 9 review fix):** `PATCH /api/files/:id`, `GET`/`PUT /api/files/:id/sharing` return 404 for documents whose `purpose` is not `file`; `DELETE /api/files/:id` bins an attachment only when no card links it, otherwise 409 `{ code: "ATTACHMENT_LINKED" }`. Folder and sharing access apply only to `file` documents; attachments are readable solely through their board (Wave 9 §3.2).

<a id="content"></a>
### Content

`GET /api/files/:id/content?disposition=inline|attachment`, and `HEAD` on the same URL. Any reader may call it. The default disposition is `attachment`.

Response headers:

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Content-Type` | `inline` and `preview_kind ≠ none` → the stored `mime_type` (text → `text/plain; charset=utf-8`). Otherwise `application/octet-stream`. |
| `Content-Disposition` | `inline` only if requested **and** `preview_kind ≠ none`; otherwise `attachment`. The filename format is `filename="<ascii-fallback>"; filename*=UTF-8''<percent-encoded NFC name>`. For the ASCII fallback, replace non-ASCII characters with `_`, strip `"`, `\`, CR, LF, and control characters, and fall back to `download` if the result is empty. |
| `Content-Length` | Byte length of the body |
| `Accept-Ranges` | `bytes` |
| `ETag` | `"<sha256>"` (strong) |
| `Last-Modified` | `updated_at` in HTTP-date format |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'none'; sandbox` for every response except inline PDF, which gets `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'` (see DEVELOPMENT_PLAN §7.2 verification). The global `secureHeaders` middleware overwrites headers after `next()`, so this route must be excluded from it and set these headers itself. |
| `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` | `DENY`, `no-referrer` (set by the route, since the global middleware is skipped here) |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` |
| `Cache-Control` | `private, no-store` |

Range handling (RFC 9110):

- `Range: bytes=a-b`, `bytes=a-`, and `bytes=-n` are supported. If the range is satisfiable → **206** with `Content-Range: bytes start-end/size`. `end` is clamped to `size-1`.
- Multiple ranges (a comma in the header) → the range is ignored and the response is **200** with the full body.
- A malformed `Range` or a non-`bytes` unit → ignored, **200**.
- Unsatisfiable (`start ≥ size`, a suffix of 0, or any range on a 0-byte file) → **416** with `Content-Range: bytes */size` and an empty body.
- If `If-Range` is present and does not exactly equal the current ETag → the range is ignored, **200**. HTTP-date `If-Range` values are also treated as a mismatch.
- `HEAD` returns the same status and headers with no body.

Errors:

- 404 when the document is not readable
- 500 `{ error: "Something went wrong" }` on an integrity failure: missing object, size mismatch, or a symlink. The server logs the error class and document id and never the filename.

Downloads and previews are **not** audited individually, by design, to avoid noise.

Streaming: open the object with `O_NOFOLLOW` and verify it with `fstat`, then stream `start..end` from the fd, using a Node read stream converted with `Readable.toWeb`. The fd must close when the client aborts.

> **Implementation notes (shipped in v0.3.0):** Bun sends streamed 200/206 bodies with `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` rather than the `Content-Length` the route sets; HEAD, 416, and empty responses carry `Content-Length`. Content responses do not carry the global HSTS or Permissions-Policy headers, since the route replaces `secureHeaders`. Both were accepted in the Wave 3 review.

<a id="bin"></a>
## Bin

Every Bin endpoint is scoped to the caller's own items, plus binned cards they deleted (below). `:type` is `note`, `document`, `card`, `board`, `collection`, `collection_row`, `calendar`, or `event` (see [Calendar § Bin](#calendar-items-in-the-bin)); any other value returns 400.

**Cards and boards (Wave 9, D41).** A binned board is listed for its owner. A binned card is listed for the board owner and for the member who deleted it, while that member can still open the board. Either can restore the card; only the board owner deletes it forever (403 `OWNER_ONLY` for the deleter). Cards and boards have no bytes, so a purge never returns 202. Purging a card or board deletes its comments and links; a document that loses its last link moves to its uploader's Bin. A restored attachment document with no links becomes an ordinary Files item (`purpose = 'file'`) in its folder or Default.

**Card subtrees (sub-wave 17A, D129, D130, T114).** `DELETE /api/tasks/cards/:k` also bins the card's live children and grandchildren in the same transaction, tagged with the root (`cards.bin_root_id`), and answers `{ ok, purgeAfter, descendantCount }`. Only the root is a Bin item: it is listed with `descendant_count` (omitted when 0), and its descendants return 404 on restore and delete forever. Restoring the root restores exactly its group, each card in its old column (or the first one) at the bottom, in its old order, and the answer adds `descendantCount`. A descendant binned on its own first is its own root and keeps its entry; restored while its parent is still binned, it comes back without a parent and the answer says `detached: true` (a parent purged meanwhile was already cleared by `ON DELETE SET NULL`). Purging a root purges its group, by hand, by Empty Bin, and by the sweeper, which only picks roots. The live-card cap counts the whole group. Audit: `task.card_delete`, `task.card_restore`, and `task.card_purge` add `descendantCount` (and `detached`).

### List

`GET /api/bin?type=note|document|card|board` (the `type` filter is optional; `document` lists Files items only, while attachments appear in the unfiltered list) → 200 `{ items: BinItem[] }`, ordered by `deleted_at DESC`, with a limit of 500. Notes in the list: `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` (blank unpublished notes never enter the Bin; they are purged immediately).

### Restore

`POST /api/bin/:type/:id/restore` with body `{}`:

| Status | When | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | Restored | `{ ok: true, folderId, folderName, visibility }`: original folder, or Default when the original is gone or not owned. `visibility` is the new effective visibility, because a Default fallback can change it. |
| 200 | Already live (owner) | `{ ok: true, alreadyRestored: true, folderId, folderName }` |
| 200 | Card or board restored (or already live) | `{ ok: true, alreadyRestored?, boardId, boardName, columnId, columnName }`. A card returns to the bottom of its column, or of the first column when its column was deleted; `columnId`/`columnName` are null for boards. |
| 404 | Missing or not owned | `{ error }` |
| 409 | Purge in progress | `{ error, code: "PURGING" }` |
| 409 | A card whose board is in the Bin | `{ error, code: "BOARD_IN_BIN" }` |
| 409 | The board would exceed 1000 live cards, or the owner 50 live boards | `{ error, code: "LIMIT_REACHED" }` |

Restore is a compare-and-swap update under the resource lock. Share rows remain as they were, so the item's previous audience regains access. Audit: `note.restore` / `document.restore`.

### Delete forever

`DELETE /api/bin/:type/:id` with body `{}`:

| Status | When | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | Purged, or a purge was already in progress and has now finished | `{ ok: true }` |
| 202 | Purge started but byte removal failed; the sweeper will retry | `{ ok: true, pending: true }` |
| 403 | A card the caller deleted on a board they do not own | `{ error, code: "OWNER_ONLY" }` |
| 404 | No such binned item for this owner (including items already purged) | `{ error }` |
| 409 | The item is live (not in the Bin) | `{ error, code: "NOT_IN_BIN" }` |

Clients treat a 404 on a **retry** as success.

### Empty Bin

`DELETE /api/bin` with body `{}` → 200 `{ ok: true, purged: number, pending: number }`. Items are processed in batches. Failures stay marked for the sweeper. It includes the caller's binned boards and the binned cards on boards they own, never cards on other people's boards.

### Collections and rows (Wave 11, D68)

`:type` also accepts `collection` and `collection_row`, and `GET /api/bin?type=` takes either. Collection items come from a provider registered by `server/collections/bin.ts`; `BinItem` gains an optional `can_purge`.

| Type | Listed for | `title` / `folder_*` | Restore | Delete forever |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `collection` | its owner | name / null | owner; 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` at 100 live collections | owner |
| `collection_row` | the collection owner and whoever binned it | primary field / the collection's id and name | owner or deleter while they can still edit the collection (404 otherwise); 409 `PARENT_IN_BIN` while the collection is binned; 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` at 10,000 live rows | collection owner only (`can_purge: false` for others) |

A purge is one transaction (nothing lives outside SQLite) and cascades to rows, members, views, links, and search rows; documents it leaves unlinked with `purpose = 'collection_attachment'` move to the uploader's Bin. The sweeper purges collections and rows past `purge_after`, and Empty Bin purges the owner's collections and the binned rows of collections they own. Audit: `collection.restore`, `collection.purge { collectionId, reason, rowCount, binnedDocuments }`, `collection.row_restore`, `collection.row_purge`.

> **Implementation notes (shipped in v0.3.1):**
> - Purge audit events (`note.purge`, `document.purge`) record `reason`: `user`, `blank`, `retention`, or `resumed`. `resumed` marks a purge the sweeper finished after an interruption; the original reason is not stored.
> - The sweeper's Bin step has two separate budgets per table and run: up to 50 interrupted purges resumed, then up to 100 items past `purge_after`. Retention is re-checked under the lock, so an item restored and deleted again mid-run is not purged. Remaining items wait for the next hourly run.

## Search (Wave 7)

`GET /api/search?q=&scope=notes&folder=all|shared|<uuid>&limit=20` searches note titles and bodies ([WAVES_7-9.md](WAVES_7-9.md) §2).

| Parameter | Default | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | `""` | At most 200 characters. It is never passed to FTS5 as syntax: it is NFKC-normalized and lowercased, up to 4 `"quoted phrases"` are kept, the rest is split into up to 8 words of 2–64 letters, numbers, or combining marks, and every word must match (implicit AND). The last word matches as a prefix unless `q` ends in a space or punctuation. A `q` with nothing searchable returns no results. |
| `scope` | `notes` | Only `notes` |
| `folder` | `all` | `all`, `shared` (notes owned by others), or a folder id. A folder id matches the masked `folder_id` below. |
| `limit` | `20` | Integer 1–50 |

```ts
type Segment = { text: string; hit: boolean };  // plain text, never HTML
type NoteSearchHit = {
  id: string;
  source: "published" | "draft";  // draft only for the owner, when a draft exists
  title: Segment[];                // highlighted title
  snippet: Segment[];              // body excerpt around the hits, "…" where cut
  folder_id: string | null;        // masked as in GET /api/notes
  owner_name: string;
  is_owner: 0 | 1;
  visibility: Visibility;          // effective, as in GET /api/notes
  updated_at: string;
};
```

| Status | When | Body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | Always, including no matches | `{ results: NoteSearchHit[], truncated: boolean }`, ordered by relevance (title matches weigh 8×) then `updated_at DESC`. `truncated` means more than `limit` notes matched. Scores are never returned. |
| 400 | Bad `scope`, `folder`, or `limit`, or `q` over 200 characters | `{ error: "Invalid request", details }` |
| 429 | More than 20 searches in 10 seconds by this user | `{ error, code: "RATE_LIMITED" }` with `Retry-After` in seconds |

Access is the live `GET /api/notes/:id` rule, applied in the query before `LIMIT`: a note's owner searches their draft when one exists and the published version otherwise; everyone else searches the published version of notes they can read. Binned notes never match; restoring one makes it searchable again, and purging removes its index rows. The index holds the published version and the owner's draft, built from checksum-verified files in the same transaction as each change.

### Collection rows (Wave 11)

`GET /api/search?scope=collections&q=&collection=all|<uuid>&limit=20` uses the same query builder, rate limit, limit bounds, and segments. `folder` is ignored; a `collection` that is neither `all` nor a UUID is 400.

```ts
type RowSearchHit = { rowId: string; collectionId: string; collectionName: string; title: Segment[]; snippet: Segment[]; updated_at: string };
```

→ 200 `{ results: RowSearchHit[], truncated }`. The live `readableCollection` rule is applied in the query before `LIMIT` (T60); binned rows and rows of binned collections never match. The title is the primary field; the body is the other text, url, number, and date values and chosen option labels. Note titles and file names are never indexed (T59). Rows are indexed in the transaction that writes them (`collection_row_search` + `collection_row_fts`), a schema change reindexes its collection, and boot reconciles entries whose `source_revision` or `schema_version` is stale.

## Tasks (Wave 9)

Task Boards ([WAVES_7-9.md](WAVES_7-9.md) §3). Every endpoint is under `/api/tasks`, takes and returns JSON, and inherits the global session, Origin, CSRF, `Content-Type: application/json`, and TOTP rules. Path ids are UUIDs (400 otherwise) and are always joined to a board the caller can read.

**Roles (D38, D39; levels since Wave 32).** A board's readers are its owner, its members and groups when `visibility = 'selected'`, and every user when `visibility = 'all_users'`. Readers at `edit` (every member before Wave 32, and the default) create, edit, move, and bin cards; `comment` comments and reacts; `view` reads; managers also rename the board and change its columns, tags, and sprints (see "Groups, levels, and item access"). Only the owner deletes it and uses the `/sharing` route. A caller who cannot read the board gets **404**; a reader below the level an endpoint needs gets **403** `{ error, code: "READ_ONLY" | "MANAGER_REQUIRED" | "OWNER_ONLY" }`. Binned boards are unreadable for everyone.

**Caps** (409 `{ error, code: "LIMIT_REACHED" }`): 50 live boards per owner, 20 columns per board, 1000 live cards per board.

```ts
type BoardSummary = {
  id: string; name: string;          // 1–120 characters, trimmed, no control characters
  owner_id: string; owner_name: string; is_owner: 0 | 1;
  visibility: Visibility;
  card_count: number;                // live cards
  created_at: string; updated_at: string;
};
type BoardColumn = {
  id: string; board_id: string; name: string /* 1–60 */; position: number;
  is_done: 0 | 1;                    // migration 011
  wip_limit: number | null;          // Wave 13 (D108): 1–1000, or null for no limit
  state: "todo" | "doing" | "done";  // migration 020 (D141); is_done = (state = "done")
  created_at: string; updated_at: string;
};
```

Positions are computed by the server (D40) and never accepted from clients: a new item goes to the midpoint of its neighbours, to last + 1024 at the bottom, or to half the first position at the top. When a gap would drop below 1e-6, the whole column (or the board's column list) is renumbered to 1024, 2048, … and the response says `renormalized: true`. Ordering changes run under the `board:<id>` lock.

### Boards

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /boards` | any | 200 `{ boards: BoardSummary[] }`: owned boards first, then shared ones, each by name (limit 500) | |
| `POST /boards { name, template?, tz? }` | any | 201 `{ board, columns }`. Without `template` (or `kanban`): To do, Doing, Done at 1024, 2048, 3072. `template` (17A, D136) is one of `kanban`, `todo`, `checklist`, `scrum`, `epics`, `triage`, `content` (`shared/boardStructure.ts` `TEMPLATES`): it sets the columns with their states, the structure, and for `triage` the tags Bug and Regression; no template creates cards (the Scrum sprint is 17B). Audit `task.board_create` adds `template` when not `kanban` | 400 (an unknown template or `tz`), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` |
| `GET /boards/:b` | reader | 200 `{ board, columns, cards: BoardCard[], users: Record<userId, { display_name, can_read }>, tags: BoardTag[] }` (columns and cards by position, tags by name). Wave 13 adds `tags`, and each card adds `relation_count` and `open_blockers` for this viewer (§ Relations). **v0.9.0 (D113 trim):** `BoardCard` is `CardSummary & RelationCounts` without `board_id`, `assignees`, `assignee_id`, and `assignee_name`, plus `assignee_ids: string[]` (assignment order); `users` names every assignee on the board once, with `can_read` for this board. `GET /cards/:k`, the card write responses, and MCP keep `assignees[]` objects. | 404 |
| `PATCH /boards/:b { name }` | owner | 200 `{ board }` | 400, 403, 404 |
| `DELETE /boards/:b` | owner | 200 `{ ok: true, purgeAfter }`: the board moves to the Bin for 30 days | 403, 404 |

The board and its cards stay together in the Bin; see § Bin for restore and purge. Audit: `task.board_restore`, `task.card_restore`, `task.board_purge`, `task.card_purge { reason: "user" | "retention" }`.

### Sharing

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /boards/:b/sharing` | owner | 200 `{ visibility, users: [{ id, display_name }] }` | 403, 404 |
| `PUT /boards/:b/sharing { visibility: "private" \| "selected" \| "all_users", userIds ≤ 100 }` | owner | 200 `{ ok: true }` | 400, 403, 404 |

Same rules as folder sharing: the owner cannot be a recipient (400), `selected` needs at least one user (400), every user must exist and be enabled (400), and member rows are kept only for `selected`. Removing a member revokes access at once.

### Columns

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /boards/:b/columns { name, afterColumnId? }` | owner | 201 `{ column, columns }`. Omitted `afterColumnId` appends; `null` puts the column first. | 400, 403, 404 (board, or an anchor not on this board), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` |
| `PATCH /columns/:c { name?, afterColumnId?, isDone?, state?, wipLimit? }` | owner | 200 `{ column, columns, renormalized? }`. Columns carry `is_done: 0 \| 1` (migration 011); a new board's Done column starts at 1. `wipLimit` is an integer 1–1000 or `null` (Wave 13, D108) and may be set below the current count. | 400 (no field, after itself, or a bad limit), 403, 404 |
| `DELETE /columns/:c` | owner | 200 `{ ok: true, columns }` | 403, 404, 409 `COLUMN_NOT_EMPTY` (with `cardCount`) or `LAST_COLUMN` |

Binned cards do not block deleting their column; they keep `column_id = NULL` and restore to the first column.

**WIP limits (Wave 13, D108, T96).** A hard block, checked under the `board:<id>` lock for REST and MCP: creating a card in a column, or moving one in **from another column**, returns 409 `{ error, code: "COLUMN_FULL", columnId, wipLimit, cardCount }` when the column already holds `wipLimit` or more live cards. Moving within a column and moving out are always allowed, and a Bin restore never fails because of a limit (it may put the column over it). Audit: `task.column_wip { boardId, columnId, wipLimit }`.

### Cards

```ts
type CardSummary = {
  id: string; board_id: string; column_id: string; position: number;
  title: string;                     // 1–200 characters, trimmed, no control characters
  has_description: 0 | 1;            // the board view never carries descriptions
  description_excerpt: string;       // Wave 13 (D111): plain text of the description, at most 160 characters (code points), '' without one
  revision: number;                  // starts at 1, +1 on every title/description edit
  created_by: string | null; creator_name: string | null;
  due_on: string | null;             // YYYY-MM-DD (migration 011); the civil date in due_tz when a time is set
  due_time: string | null;           // Wave 13 (D100): "HH:MM" in due_tz, or null
  due_tz: string | null;             // the IANA zone the setter's browser sent (D101), set exactly when due_time is
  due_at: string | null;             // computed UTC instant (ISO) when due_time is set
  assignees: CardAssignee[];         // Wave 13 (D102): at most 20, in assignment order
  assignee_id: string | null;        // DEPRECATED (D103): assignees[0].id; gone from GET /boards/:b in v0.9.0 (D113 trim)
  assignee_name: string | null;      // DEPRECATED (D103): assignees[0].display_name; same
  tag_ids: string[];                 // Wave 13 (D109): at most 10 tags of this board, in tagging order; resolve against the board's `tags`
  flags: Flag[];                     // Wave 13 (D110): in the fixed order below
  comment_count: number; attachment_count: number;
  created_at: string; updated_at: string;
};
type CardAssignee = { id: string; display_name: string; can_read: 0 | 1 };  // 0: lost board access or disabled ("Former member", T93)
type CardDetail = CardSummary & { description: string };  // Markdown, at most 65,536 UTF-8 bytes
type Flag = "urgent" | "blocked" | "needs_review" | "on_hold";              // Wave 13 (D110), in this order
type BoardTag = { id: string; board_id: string; name: string; color: OptionColor; card_count: number };  // color: the Collections option palette; card_count: live cards carrying it
```

**Due time (Wave 13, D100–D101).** A card may carry a wall time next to its date. The client sends `dueTime` (`HH:MM`, 00:00–23:59) with `dueTz` (`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`); the server checks the zone with `isValidTimeZone` (browser aliases included), stores it as sent, and never converts it. `due_at` comes from `zonedToUtc`: a time inside a DST gap moves forward, and the earlier instant wins in an overlap. Rules (400 otherwise): a time needs a date and a zone; `dueTz` only comes with `dueTime`; `dueTime: null` clears the time and zone; changing only `dueOn` keeps the wall time and zone; `dueOn: null` also clears the time.

**Description excerpt (Wave 13, D111).** `description_excerpt` is derived on the server with the search index's `searchText` (Markdown to plain text, as MCP's `description_preview`), whitespace collapsed, and cut to 160 code points with a trailing `…`. It is written with every description write (create and `PATCH`); a patch without `description` leaves it alone. Cards written before migration 015 are filled at boot by `reconcileCardExcerpts()` (live and binned cards whose description is not empty). Clients render it as text.

**Assignees (Wave 13, D102–D103).** Assignees live in `card_assignees` (migration 015). `cards.assignee_id` is a legacy mirror of the first assignee, rewritten in the same transaction, for a rollback to v0.7.x only. Every user being **added** must be enabled and able to read the board (400 `ASSIGNEE_NOT_MEMBER`); a former member already on the card may stay until any reader removes them. Assigning never grants access.

Without `q`: at most 200 by name. With `q` (1–64 characters): a case-insensitive `instr` match on the display name (no wildcards), at most `limit` (1–50, default 20; `limit` needs `q`) | 400, 404, 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` (60 a minute per user, T92) |

Omitted `afterCardId` = bottom, `null` = top. The composer's one call: assignees, tags, flags, relations (seen from the new card, each audited `task.relation_create`, same rules as `POST /cards/:k/relations`: readable target, one per pair, 50 per card, no revision change on the target), and attachments (the caller's own `task_attachment` uploads that no card links yet, each audited `task.attachment_link`) are written in one transaction. `COLUMN_FULL` is checked first, and any refusal writes nothing. | 400 (including `ASSIGNEE_NOT_MEMBER`, more than 10 tags, an unknown or repeated flag, an unknown relation type, the same `targetCardId` twice in `relations`, or extra keys), 404 (board, a column not on this board, a tag not on this board, a relation target that is missing, binned, or unreadable, or a file that is not the caller's live attachment upload), 409 `COLUMN_FULL`, `STALE_POSITION`, `LIMIT_REACHED`, or `ATTACHMENT_LINKED` (the file is already on a card) |
| `GET /cards/:k` | reader | 200 `{ card: CardDetail, comments: CardComment[], hasMoreComments, attachments: CardAttachment[], relations: CardRelation[] }`: the newest 50 comments in chronological order, every live attachment, and the card's relations as this viewer sees them, newest first (at most 50, § Relations) | 404 |
| `PATCH /cards/:k { title?, description?, dueOn?, dueTime?, dueTz?, assigneeIds?, assigneeId?, tagIds?, flags?, revision }` | reader | 200 `{ card }` with `revision + 1`, exactly once however many fields change (one transaction). `dueOn` is a real date `YYYY-MM-DD` (1900–2999) or `null`; `dueTime`/`dueTz` follow the due-time rules above; `assigneeIds` (≤ 20 after deduplication) replaces the whole set and `[]` clears it; the legacy `assigneeId` (a user or `null`) means `[id]` or `[]` (D103) and is refused on a card that has more than one assignee (409 `ASSIGNEES_MULTIPLE`) rather than dropping the others; `tagIds` (≤ 10 after deduplication) and `flags` each replace the whole set, and `[]` clears it; omitted fields are unchanged | 400 (including `ASSIGNEE_NOT_MEMBER` when a new assignee is disabled or cannot read the board, `assigneeId` sent together with `assigneeIds`, more than 10 tags, and an unknown or repeated flag), 404 (the card, or a tag not on the card's board), 409 `{ code: "CARD_CHANGED", card }` (the current card, every field) when `revision` is not the stored one, 409 `{ code: "ASSIGNEES_MULTIPLE", assignees }` (the current assignees) when the legacy `assigneeId` is sent for a card with several assignees; send `assigneeIds` instead |
| `POST /cards/:k/move { columnId, afterCardId }` | reader | 200 `{ card, renormalized?, positions? }`. `afterCardId: null` = top. `positions` lists `{ id, position }` for the whole target column after a renumber. | 400, 404 (card, or a column not on the card's board), 409 `STALE_POSITION`, or `COLUMN_FULL` when moving in from another column |
| `DELETE /cards/:k` | reader | 200 `{ ok: true, purgeAfter }`: the card moves to the Bin and keeps its column | 404 |

- **Stale positions.** `afterCardId` must be another live card in the target column. Otherwise (binned, in another column or board, the moved card itself, or unknown) the response is 409 `{ error, code: "STALE_POSITION", columnId, order: string[] }`, where `order` is the target column's live card ids in their current order.
- **Moves** stay on the card's board and do not change `revision`, so an open editor can still save.
- Binned cards and cards on binned boards return 404 on every card route. They are restored through `POST /api/bin/card/:id/restore` (§ Bin).

### Relations (Wave 13, D104–D107)

Typed, non-structural links between two cards, on the same board or on different boards. Three kinds are stored in `card_relations` (migration 015): `relates` (symmetric, stored with `source < target`), `blocks` (source is needed before target), and `duplicates`. The API shows five types, always **from the card in the path**:

| Type sent or shown from card X toward Y | Stored `(source, target, kind)` | How Y shows it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relates_to` | `(min, max, relates)` | `relates_to` |
| `needed_by` (X blocks Y) | `(X, Y, blocks)` | `depends_on` |
| `depends_on` (Y blocks X) | `(Y, X, blocks)` | `needed_by` |
| `duplicates` | `(X, Y, duplicates)` | `duplicated_by` |
| `duplicated_by` | `(Y, X, duplicates)` | `duplicates` |

There is one relation per unordered pair, whatever its kind. There is no parent or sprint kind (the hierarchy wave adds `cards.parent_card_id`).

```ts
type RelationType = "relates_to" | "depends_on" | "needed_by" | "duplicates" | "duplicated_by";
type CardRelation =
  | { id: string; type: RelationType; restricted: false; created_at: string; creator_name: string | null;
      card: { id: string; board_id: string; board_name: string; title: string; column_name: string | null; is_done: 0 | 1; due_on: string | null } }
  | { id: string; type: RelationType; restricted: true; created_at: string };   // nothing else (T90)
type RelationCounts = {
  relation_count: number;   // relations visible to this viewer: restricted rows count, hidden binned ones do not
  open_blockers: number;    // readable, live depends_on cards not in a done column
};
```

**Per-viewer resolution (D105, T90).** Each relation resolves for the caller on every read:

- the other card is live and on a board the caller can read: `restricted: false` with the card's fields
- the caller is not in the other board's audience (owner, members, or everyone on `all_users`): `restricted: true` with only `id`, `type`, `restricted`, and `created_at` (no card id, title, board, or creator), whether or not that card or board is binned, so binning is never disclosed
- the caller is in the audience but the other card or its board is in the Bin: **hidden**, and back when it is restored (binning never removes relation rows). Purging a card or board deletes its relations (cascade)

Links never grant access. Relations are **edges** (D107): they have their own endpoints and never change either card's `revision` or `updated_at`, so linking from another board never raises `CARD_CHANGED` for someone editing the card.

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /cards/:k/relations { type, cardId }` | reader of both cards | 201 `{ relation: CardRelation }`, seen from `k`. Runs under `k`'s board lock | 400 (a relation to itself, an unknown type, extra keys), 404 (`k` or `cardId` missing, binned, or unreadable; all look the same), 409 `{ code: "RELATION_EXISTS", relation }` (the existing relation seen from `k`, in either direction and of any kind; checked only after both cards are readable) or `LIMIT_REACHED` (50 relations per card, on either end) |
| `DELETE /cards/:k/relations/:r` | reader of `k` | 200 `{ ok: true }`. `k` must be one end of `r`; a restricted relation may be removed, since it is metadata on the caller's own card | 404 (`k`, or `r` not a relation of `k`) |
| `GET /cards/search?q=&boardId?&excludeCardId?&limit?` | any | 200 `{ results: { id, board_id, board_name, title, column_name, is_done }[], truncated }` for the relation picker (D106): live cards on live boards the caller can read whose title contains `q` (trimmed, 1–100 characters), case-insensitive `instr` (so `%` and `_` are literal), at most `limit` (1–20, default 20). Order: cards on `boardId` first (a hint only, never a filter or an access check), then titles starting with `q`, then `updated_at DESC`. `excludeCardId` drops the card being edited. Titles only, never descriptions | 400, 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` (20 per 10 s per user, the `/api/search` window in its own bucket, T95) |

`GET /cards/search` belongs to Tasks, not to `/api/search`; it keeps working when the Search module is hidden (D92).

### Tags and flags (Wave 13, D109, D110, T101)

Tags belong to one board: at most 100 per board (409 `LIMIT_REACHED`), names of 1–40 characters (trimmed, no control or bidi characters) unique ignoring case, and a colour from the Collections option palette (`gray`, the default, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`). **Any reader creates a tag**; **only the owner** renames, recolours, or deletes one. A card carries at most 10 tags, each of its **own** board: a tag id from any other board is 404 `Tag not found`, even for a user who reads both boards, exactly like an unknown id. Flags are the fixed set `urgent`, `blocked`, `needs_review`, `on_hold`, each at most once; `blocked` is a manual flag, separate from the relation-derived blocker count (13D). Tags and flags are card **fields** (D107): they change through `PATCH /cards/:k` with the revision compare-and-swap, and `CARD_CHANGED` carries them.

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /boards/:b/tags { name, color? }` | edit (any reader before Wave 32; since then 403 `READ_ONLY` below edit) | 201 `{ tag: BoardTag }`. Without `color` the tag takes the first palette colour (grey excluded) no tag of the board uses yet, looking from the slot the board's tag count points at, so a board cycles through the palette (operator QA 0.9.1) | 400, 404, 409 `{ code: "TAG_EXISTS", tag }` (a name that matches ignoring case, with the existing tag so a picker can use it; checked before the cap) or `LIMIT_REACHED` |
| `PATCH /tags/:t { name?, color? }` | owner | 200 `{ tag: BoardTag }`. Renaming to another case of its own name is allowed | 400 (no field), 403 `OWNER_ONLY`, 404 (unknown, or a board the caller cannot read), 409 `TAG_EXISTS` |
| `DELETE /tags/:t` | owner | 200 `{ ok: true, removedFrom }`: the tag is deleted with no Bin and unlinked from every card, binned ones included (`removedFrom` counts them all). No card's `revision` changes | 403 `OWNER_ONLY`, 404 |

A binned card keeps its tags and flags; a restore brings back the tags that still exist. Audit (ids only): `task.tag_create { boardId, tagId }`, `task.tag_update { boardId, tagId, renamed?, color? }`, `task.tag_delete { boardId, tagId, removedFrom }`; `task.card_update` and `task.card_create` add `tagsAdded`, `tagsRemoved`, and the resulting `flags` when those fields are sent.

### Comments

```ts
type CardComment = {
  id: string; card_id: string;
  author_id: string | null; author_name: string | null;  // null once the author's account is deleted
  is_author: 0 | 1;
  body: string;                        // plain text, 1–16,384 UTF-8 bytes, not only whitespace
  created_at: string; edited_at: string | null;
  reactions: ReactionAggregate[];      // Wave 20, § Reactions; [] when none
};
```

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /cards/:k/comments?before=<commentId>&limit=1–50` | reader | 200 `{ comments, hasMore }`: the `limit` comments before `before` (or the newest), in chronological order | 400, 404 (card, or `before` not a comment of this card) |
| `POST /cards/:k/comments { body, attachmentIds? }` | reader | 201 `{ comment }`. The author is always the session user. `attachmentIds` (≤ 10) are linked through the comment, with the linking rules below. | 400, 404 (card, or a file that is not the caller's live attachment), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (500 comments per card, 10 attachments per comment, 50 per card) |
| `PATCH /comments/:m { body }` | author | 200 `{ comment }` with `edited_at` set | 400, 403 `AUTHOR_ONLY`, 404 |
| `DELETE /comments/:m` | author or board owner | 200 `{ ok: true }`. Comments are deleted outright, not binned; links made through the comment go with it. | 403 `AUTHOR_ONLY`, 404 |

Comments on binned cards, binned boards, or boards the caller can no longer read return 404.

### Reactions (Wave 20, D182–D190, migration 022)

People who may comment may react to a comment with one of 12 fixed emoji. Keys, not glyphs, are stored and sent (`shared/reactions.ts`): `thumbs_up` 👍, `thumbs_down` 👎, `heart` ❤️, `laugh` 😂, `tada` 🎉, `eyes` 👀, `rocket` 🚀, `check` ✅, `fire` 🔥, `thinking` 🤔, `pray` 🙏, `sad` 😢.

```ts
type ReactionAggregate = {
  emoji: ReactionKey;   // one of the 12 keys
  count: number;        // everyone who reacted with it (blocked accounts are not counted while blocked)
  reacted: boolean;     // the caller is one of them
  names: string[];      // the other people (never the caller), oldest first, at most 10
  more: number;         // the other people beyond those 10: count = names.length + more + (reacted ? 1 : 0)
};
```

Each comment's `reactions` is ordered by the first reaction's time and comes from one grouped query per comment page (at most 50), in `GET /cards/:k`, `GET /cards/:k/comments`, and the comment create and edit responses.

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PUT /comments/:m/reactions/:emoji` | a reader of the card whose role may write content | 200 `{ reactions: ReactionAggregate[] }` for that comment. Idempotent: already reacted is still 200 with no change. | 400 `INVALID_EMOJI`, 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` (viewers and guests, the write gate), 404 (unknown, unreadable, or on a binned card or board), 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` |
| `DELETE /comments/:m/reactions/:emoji` | same | 200 `{ reactions }`. Idempotent: absent is still 200. | same |
| `PUT` and `DELETE /api/reactions/:kind/:targetId/:emoji` | same, per kind | The generic form of the two above; v1 registers only `card_comment` (`server/reactions/targets.ts`). | 404 for an unknown or malformed kind or id, otherwise as above |

The body is empty; the session, Origin, JSON `Content-Type`, CSRF, TOTP, and role gates still apply. The UI "toggle" chooses the verb from the chip's current state, so a retry or a double tap never flips twice. Writes are limited to 60 a minute per user (in memory). Reactions are not audited, create no notifications, are not searchable, and never change the card's `revision` or `updated_at`. Deleting a comment, or purging its card or board, deletes its reactions (a trigger on `card_comments`); a binned card's reactions are hidden until it is restored. A later module adds its own kind with `registerReactionTarget` and a cleanup trigger, with no change to the table.

### Attachments

```ts
type CardAttachment = {
  document_id: string; card_id: string;
  comment_id: string | null;           // set when linked through a comment
  linked_by: string | null; linker_name: string | null;
  name: string; mime_type: string; preview_kind: PreviewKind; size_bytes: number;
  created_at: string;                   // when it was linked
};
```

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /cards/:k/attachments { documentId, commentId? }` | reader | 201 `{ attachment }`, or 200 when this owner already linked it | 400, 404 (card; a document that is not a live `task_attachment` owned by the caller; a comment that is not the caller's own on this card), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (50 per card, 10 per comment) |
| `DELETE /cards/:k/attachments/:d` | linker or board owner | 200 `{ ok: true, movedToBin }` | 403 `LINKER_ONLY`, 404 |

- **Reading (D43).** `GET /api/files/:id` and `/content` also admit a caller when the live document is linked to a live card on a board they can read. This never applies to lists. Access ends the moment the member is removed, the card or board is binned, the comment is deleted, or the link is removed.
- **Lifecycle (director review §7).** Unlinking never deletes the file directly. When a document loses its last link (unlink, comment deleted, card or board purged), it moves to its uploader's Bin with `deleted_by` = the actor, and purges 30 days later. Binning a card keeps its links, so restoring the card brings its attachments back.
- **Discard and never linked (Wave 13, §5.6, T100).** A client that uploaded files it will not attach (the composer's "Don't attach", a cancelled comment) discards each with `DELETE /api/files/:id`: only the uploader can, anyone else gets the same 404 as a missing id, and a linked file is 409 `ATTACHMENT_LINKED`. The file moves to the uploader's Bin (`document.delete { documentId }`), and restoring it there makes it an ordinary Files item. Anything the client leaves behind is caught by the hourly sweeper: a live `task_attachment` with no `card_attachments` row that is more than 24 hours old moves to its uploader's Bin (100 per run, `deleted_by = NULL`, audit `document.delete { documentId, reason: "attachment_never_linked" }`).
- Inline images in a description use the same content URL, `/api/files/:id/content?disposition=inline`.

**Audit** (ids only, never names or text): `task.board_create`, `task.board_rename`, `task.board_delete`, `task.board_sharing_changed { boardId, visibility, recipientCount }`, `task.column_create`, `task.column_rename`, `task.column_move`, `task.column_delete`, `task.column_wip { wipLimit }`, `task.card_create { assigneesAdded? }`, `task.card_update { dueOn?, dueTime?: "set" | "cleared", assigneeId?, assigneesAdded?, assigneesRemoved? }` (counts, not ids), `task.card_move { boardId, cardId, columnId }`, `task.card_delete`, and `task.comment_create` / `task.comment_update` / `task.comment_delete { boardId, cardId, commentId }`, `task.attachment_link` / `task.attachment_unlink { boardId, cardId, documentId, commentId? }`, `task.relation_create` / `task.relation_delete { boardId, cardId, relationId, kind }` (`boardId` and `cardId` are the path card's, `kind` the stored kind), and `document.delete { documentId, reason: "attachment_unlinked" }` when an unlinked file moves to the Bin, each with `{ boardId, columnId?, cardId? }`.
### Hierarchy (sub-wave 17A, D120–D135, migration 019)

Cards form a tree of at most three levels on one board. `level` 0 is the top ("Epic"), 1 sits under it, 2 under that; the names come from the board's structure (§ Board structure). A card's parent is optional at and above the board's work level (an orphan story is fine), but **required below it**: a subtask is created, reparented, or re-levelled only under a parent (400 `PARENT_REQUIRED`, operator QA 0.9.1). The one exception is a subtask restored while its parent is in the Bin, which comes back detached (D130): it stays readable and editable, and the next placement change must name a parent or move it to the work level. When set, the parent is a **live card on the same board exactly one level up** (D121). Levels strictly increase downward, so a cycle is impossible and no ancestor walk is ever needed (T110); two triggers in 019 refuse any write that would break the rule, as a backstop to the service.

```ts
type CardSummary = /* … */ & {
  parent_card_id: string | null;     // same board, one level up (D121)
  level: 0 | 1 | 2;                  // below the board's level count
  child_count: number;               // live direct children
  done_child_count: number;          // of those, in a done column (D125)
};
type ChildCard = { id; title; level; column_id; column_name; is_done: 0 | 1; position; due_on; child_count; done_child_count };
// GET /cards/:k adds, on the card:
type CardHierarchy = {
  parent: { id; title; level } | null;
  ancestors: { id; title; level }[];  // root first, at most 2 (the breadcrumb)
  children: ChildCard[];              // live direct children by column position, then card position, at most 100
};
```

| Endpoint | Who | Change | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /boards/:b/cards` | reader | adds `parentId?: uuid \| null` and `level?: 0–2`. The level defaults to the parent's plus one, else the board's work level. | 400 `PARENT_INVALID` (unknown, another board, binned, the card itself, or not one level up: always the same code and message, T113), 400 `LEVEL_INVALID` (at or past the board's level count), 400 `PARENT_REQUIRED { level }` (a level below the work level with no parent; the message reads "Pick the task this subtask belongs to, or make it a task"), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (the parent has 100 live children) |
| `PATCH /cards/:k` | reader | adds `parentId?: uuid \| null` (reparent, D128) and `level?: 0–2` ("Change level"), under the revision CAS like every field (`revision + 1`). Without `level` the card keeps its level, so a new parent must be one level up; send both to move a card to another level. A card with live children cannot change level; children that were binned on their own are detached, so they restore without a parent (D130). Detaching a subtask (`parentId: null`) or moving a card below the work level without a parent is 400 `PARENT_REQUIRED`; send `{ level: workLevel, parentId: null }` to make it a work-level card instead. A PATCH that sends neither `parentId` nor `level` never checks the parent, so a detached subtask keeps working. | as above, plus 409 `HAS_CHILDREN { childCount }` and 409 `CARD_CHANGED` |
| `GET /cards/:k/children` | reader | `{ children: ChildCard[] }` | 404 |

- **Roll-ups (D125, D134).** `child_count` and `done_child_count` count a card's live direct children and those in an `is_done` column. `GET /boards/:b` and MCP `list_cards` compute them with one grouped query per board, never a per-card subquery; the board payload has every live card at every level, so a client can also derive them locally. A parent never moves on its own when its children do.
- **Audit** (ids only): `task.card_create` adds `parentId` and `level` when set; `task.card_reparent { boardId, cardId, parentId }`; `task.card_level { boardId, cardId, level }`.
- **WIP limits** count every card in a column, whatever its level (§8, Q7).
- There is no endpoint that changes a card's board, so a parent never ends up on another board (T112).

### Board structure (sub-wave 17A, D122, D123, T120)

```ts
type BoardStructure = {
  levels: { name: string; plural: string }[];   // 1–3, top first; names 1–24 characters, trimmed, no control characters
  workLevel: number;                              // 0 … levels.length − 1: where new cards are created and what columns show
  sprints: boolean;                               // "Sprint ›" is the outer grouping (17B); never a card level
  sprintDefaults?: {                              // optional (2026-09-27): what a new sprint starts with on this board
    days: number;                                 // 1–60, start and end included
    start: "next" | "today" | "mon" | "tue" | "wed" | "thu" | "fri" | "sat" | "sun";  // the day after the previous open sprint ends (else today), today, or that weekday on or after "next"
    name?: string;                                // 1–40 characters with exactly one "{n}" ("Sprint {n}"), trimmed, no control characters; absent: follow the latest sprint's name
  };
};
```

`BoardSummary` adds `structure` (every board starts Flat: `{ levels: [{ name: "Card", plural: "Cards" }], workLevel: 0, sprints: false }`). Presets (`shared/boardStructure.ts`): Flat, Task › Subtask, Sprint › Task, Sprint › Task › Subtask, Epic › Story › Subtask (work level Story); anything else is Custom. `sprintDefaults` never changes the preset. It lives in `boards.structure_json` (no migration; the largest structure with defaults stays under the 1024-character CHECK). The Scrum template sets `{ days: 14, start: "next", name: "Sprint {n}" }`; a board without defaults suggests a sprint as long as the latest one, named after it. `{n}` is one more than the highest number any of the board's sprints has in that pattern, skipping names in use. The defaults only suggest: `POST /boards/:b/sprints` still takes explicit dates.

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PATCH /boards/:b { name?, structure? }` | owner | 200 `{ board }`; at least one field. A `structure` without the `sprintDefaults` key keeps the stored defaults (so a levels-only save never drops them); `sprintDefaults: null` clears them | 400 (an invalid structure, with `details`), 403, 404, 409 `LEVEL_IN_USE { level, cardCount, binnedCount, levels: [{ level, name, cardCount }] }` (a card, live or in the Bin, sits at a level being removed), 409 `SPRINTS_IN_USE` (sprints turned off while sprints are open, or the work level moved while cards carry a sprint) |

Audit: `task.board_structure { boardId, levels, workLevel, sprints }` (counts only, no names).

### Sprints (sub-wave 17B, D124, D131, D132, D135, T118)

A sprint is its own entity (`board_sprints`, migration 019), never a card level. A board with `structure.sprints` has any number of sprints; **at most one is active** (a partial unique index). Only **work-level** cards store a sprint; a card below the work level has its parent's sprint (derived on every read, never stored), and a card above it has none. Sprint management is **owner-only** (D132); any reader plans cards into sprints, since that is a card field.

```ts
type SprintSummary = {
  id; board_id; name: string /* 1–60 */; goal: string /* ≤ 500 */;
  start_on: string | null; end_on: string | null;            // YYYY-MM-DD, start ≤ end
  state: "planned" | "active" | "completed";                  // stored as planned/active/closed
  is_active: boolean; position: number; completed_at: string | null;
  card_count: number; done_count: number;                     // live cards stored in it (work level), and those in a done column
  created_at; updated_at;
};
type CardSummary = /* … */ & { sprint_id: string | null };   // stored (work level) or inherited (below), null above and in the backlog
```

`GET /boards/:b` adds `sprints: SprintSummary[]`: every open sprint (the active one first, then planned by position) plus the five latest completed ones (`[]` on a board that never had sprints).

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /boards/:b/sprints?state=&cursor=&limit=` | reader | 200 `{ sprints, nextCursor }`. Without `state`: every open sprint, then completed ones newest first, paged (`limit` 1–100, default 20). `state=planned\|active\|completed` narrows it; `cursor` continues the completed pages. | 400 (`state`, `limit`, `CURSOR_INVALID`), 404 |
| `POST /boards/:b/sprints { name, goal?, startOn?, endOn? }` | owner | 201 `{ sprint }`, planned, at the end | 400, 403, 404, 409 `SPRINTS_OFF` (the board plans no sprints), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (50 planned or active) |
| `PATCH /sprints/:s { name?, goal?, startOn?, endOn?, afterSprintId?, state?: "active" }` | owner | 200 `{ sprint }`. `afterSprintId` (null = first) reorders an open sprint; `state: "active"` starts a planned sprint | 400 (end before start, anything but `active`), 403, 404, 409 `SPRINT_ACTIVE { activeSprintId }`, 409 `SPRINT_COMPLETED` |
| `DELETE /sprints/:s` | owner | 200 `{ ok }`; only a planned sprint no live card is planned in (binned cards in it fall back to no sprint) | 403, 404, 409 `SPRINT_NOT_PLANNED`, 409 `SPRINT_NOT_EMPTY { cardCount }` |
| `POST /sprints/:s/complete { carryTo, name?, startOn?, endOn? }` | owner | 200 `{ sprint, carried, doneCount, target, created }`. Completes the active sprint with carry-over in one transaction under the board lock (D131, T118): its live cards outside a done column at that moment move to `carryTo` with `revision + 1`; cards in a done column stay with the completed sprint; subtasks follow their parent. `carryTo`: `next` (the first planned sprint), `backlog` (no sprint), `new` (a sprint created in the same call: `name` defaults to the board's name pattern, else the next number, "Sprint 13"; the dates to the board's default length, else this one's, from today, moved to the default start weekday when one is set), or a planned sprint's id. `name`, `startOn`, and `endOn` go only with `new`. `target` is the destination sprint (null for the backlog). | 400, 403, 404 (a sprint that is not a planned sprint of this board), 409 `SPRINT_NOT_ACTIVE`, 409 `NO_NEXT_SPRINT`, 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (`new` at 50 open) |
| `POST /boards/:b/cards` | reader | adds `sprintId?: uuid \| null`; `null` files the card in the backlog. **Omitted**, a card at the work level of a board with sprints on joins the board's active sprint when there is one (v0.11.0 Friction 3: routines and MCP clients rarely pass it), else the backlog; below the work level nothing is stored. The app always sends it (the Backlog stays reachable through the sprint switcher) | 400 `SPRINTS_OFF`, 400 `SPRINT_LEVEL` (below or above the work level), 404 (a sprint of another board or unknown), 409 `SPRINT_COMPLETED` |
| `PATCH /cards/:k` | reader | adds `sprintId?: uuid \| null` under the revision CAS (`revision + 1`); `null` puts the card in the backlog. A "Change level" away from the work level clears the stored sprint. | as above, plus 409 `CARD_CHANGED` |

- A sprint id is joined to its board: a sprint of a board the caller cannot read is 404, whatever the action.
- `PATCH /boards/:b` refuses `sprints: false` while sprints are open, and a work-level change while cards carry a sprint (409 `SPRINTS_IN_USE`, § Board structure).
- The **Scrum sprint board** template (`POST /boards { template: "scrum" }`) also creates a planned "Sprint 1" for two weeks (its `sprintDefaults.days`) from today in `tz` (the creator's IANA zone, as the web app sends), else UTC. Completing a sprint into a new one (`carryTo: "new"`) dates it from today, as long as the completed one, never after an end date that has not come yet; completed on its last day, it starts tomorrow.
- **The board page** keeps the sprint on screen in its URL as `?sprint=backlog|all|<id>`, beside `view`, `group`, and `sort` (absent = the current sprint: the active one, else the backlog), and carries it through card routes. It scopes every view with one more `sprint:` term (§ Filter grammar); the filter bar keeps only the viewer's own terms. Picking a sprint pushes a history entry (a committed choice, like the view switch).
- **Audit** (ids only): `task.sprint_create { boardId, sprintId }`, `task.sprint_update { boardId, sprintId, fields }`, `task.sprint_start`, `task.sprint_delete`, `task.sprint_complete { boardId, sprintId, carried, doneCount, carryTo: "next" | "backlog" | "new" | "sprint", targetSprintId? }` (a `new` target is also a `task.sprint_create`); `task.card_create` and `task.card_update` add `sprintId` when it is set or changes. Carried cards get no per-card audit row: the completion row counts them.

### Filter grammar (sub-wave 17C, D137, D140–D145)

One grammar for the board filter bar (13E), cross-board queries, saved views, URLs, and MCP. It lives in `shared/taskQuery.ts`, a pure module that the server and the client both import (research 2026-09-26 §10.3, Q10). A query is terms separated by spaces: **terms AND together**, the **values of one term OR together**, and a leading `-` negates a term.

```text
assignee:me state:todo,doing due:overdue,week
board:<uuid> column:<uuid> -tag:"Needs design",none flag:blocked "invoice"
```

| Key | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `board` | uuid | the card's board. A board the caller cannot read matches nothing (never an error) |
| `state` | `todo`, `doing`, `done` | the column's normalized state (migration 020) |
| `column` | uuid | only with exactly one positive `board:` value (or on a board page), else 400 `FILTER_SCOPE` |
| `assignee` | `me`, `none`, uuid | any assignee matches; `none` = no assignees |
| `creator` | `me`, uuid | who created the card |
| `tag` | `none`, uuid, or a name (1–40) | names match board tags case-insensitively, so one name works across boards |
| `flag` | `urgent`, `blocked`, `needs_review`, `on_hold`, `none` | the manual card flags |
| `due` | `overdue`, `today`, `week`, `next-week`, `none`, `YYYY-MM-DD`, `<YYYY-MM-DD`, `>YYYY-MM-DD` | relative values use the caller's `tz`; `week` is today plus six days, `next-week` the seven after; `overdue` is a date before today, or a timed card due today whose wall time has passed. `before:D`/`after:D` are accepted as `<D`/`>D` |
| `parent` | `none`, uuid | the card's parent (17A); `none` = no parent. Parents are on the same board, so another board's card matches nothing |
| `level` | `work`, `0`, `1`, `2` | the card's level (17A); `work` is each board's own work level |
| `sprint` | `current`, `next`, `none` (`backlog` is read as `none`), uuid | the card's sprint (17B): stored on the work level, the parent's below it, none above it. `current` is each card's own board's active sprint and `next` its first planned one (so they work across boards); a sprint of another board matches nothing |
| `has` | `relation`, `blocked`, `subtasks` | any visible relation; an open `depends_on` blocker; at least one live child (17A) |
| text | `"quoted phrase"` or a bare word | the title or the description excerpt contains it (case-insensitive `instr`, no wildcards) |

- **No reserved keys remain.** `parent:`, `level:`, and `has:subtasks` shipped with 17A and `sprint:` with 17B, in the board's in-memory matcher (`matchesQuery`) and the cross-board compiler alike (`tests/taskQueryParity.test.ts`). `FILTER_UNSUPPORTED` stays in the error vocabulary for keys a later wave reserves.
- **Canonical form.** `format` orders terms by key (`board state column assignee creator tag flag due sprint parent level has text`, positive before negated), dedupes and sorts values, lowercases ids and keywords, and always quotes text. URLs (`?q=`), `task_views.query`, and MCP carry the canonical form.
- **Limits.** At most 2000 characters, 20 terms, 20 values per term, 100 characters per text term. No control or bidi characters.
- **Errors.** `{ code: "FILTER_INVALID" | "FILTER_UNSUPPORTED" | "FILTER_SCOPE", message, position }`, where `position` is the character offset.
- **One grammar with the Wave 13 structured filter.** The same module holds 13C's `CardFilter` and board pipeline (`queryCards`, `sortCards`, used by the client and mirrored by `list_cards` in `server/tasks/cardQuery.ts`). `queryFromCardFilter` gives a structured filter its canonical text, and `cardFilterFromQuery` turns a board-scoped query back into a `CardFilter`, or `null` when it uses what the board pipeline does not model (negation, `board:`, `state:`, `creator:`, `has:`, tag names, relative due windows, repeated keys); those run on the server. `tests/taskQueryParity.test.ts` checks that the three paths agree.
- **URL codec.** `?q=` carries the canonical grammar and is the only filter parameter written. Decoding is lenient (bad terms and values are dropped) and still reads the Wave 13 per-key parameters (`assignee`, `tag`, `flag`, `due`, `column`, `rel=any|blocked|none`, plus `board` and `state`), so older links keep working. Other parameters (`view`, `layout`, `group`, `sort`, and the board's `sprint`, 17B) are left alone.

### Cross-board card query (sub-wave 17C, D144)

`POST /api/tasks/query` is a read sent as POST (like the Collections query). Any signed-in user; the usual session, Origin, and CSRF rules apply.

| Body | Result | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{ q?: string (grammar, ≤ 2000, default ""), sort?: "due" \| "updated" \| "created" \| "title" \| "board" (default due), group?: "none" \| "board" \| "state" \| "due", cursor?, limit?: 1–100 (default 50), tz?: IANA (default UTC) }` (no other keys) | `{ query, cards: QueriedCard[], nextCursor: string \| null, total?, refs? }` | 400 `FILTER_INVALID` / `FILTER_UNSUPPORTED` / `FILTER_SCOPE` `{ position }`, 400 `CURSOR_INVALID`, 400 (body), 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` (30 per 10 s per user) |

```ts
type QueriedCard = {
  id; board_id; board_name; column_id; column_name; column_state: "todo" | "doing" | "done"; is_done: 0 | 1;
  position; title; description_excerpt; revision; created_by; creator_name;
  due_on; due_time; due_tz; due_at;                  // as on the board (Wave 13)
  assignees: CardAssignee[];                         // with can_read, as on the board
  tags: { id; name; color }[]; flags: Flag[];        // flags in the fixed order
  created_at; updated_at;
  parent_card_id; level; parent_title: string | null;  // 17A: the parent on the same board (D138); null when none or binned
  sprint_id: string | null; sprint_name: string | null;  // 17B: the card's sprint (inherited below the work level) and its name
};
type QueryRefs = {                                   // first page only: what the query's ids mean to this caller (T116)
  boards:  ({ id; name } | { id; restricted: true })[];
  columns: ({ id; name; board_id } | { id; restricted: true })[];
  tags:    ({ id; name; color; board_id } | { id; restricted: true })[];
  users:   ({ id; display_name } | { id; unknown: true })[];   // the exposure of GET /api/users
};
```

- **Column state.** `state:` and `column_state` read `board_columns.state` (migration 020).
- **Access.** Only live cards on live boards the caller can read (`readableBoardPredicate`), ANDed before any filter, sort, or limit. A board, column, or tag id the caller cannot read matches nothing and resolves as `restricted`, exactly like an id that does not exist.
- **Order and paging.** Keyset pagination on the group key, then the sort key, then the card id. `due` sorts by date then time with undated cards last; `updated` and `created` are newest first; `title` is case-insensitive; `board` is board name, column position, card position. `group` orders by the group first (board name; state todo → doing → done; due bucket overdue → today → this week → later → none), so a group is one contiguous run across pages; assignee and tag grouping are done by the client within the loaded cards. `nextCursor` is opaque and only continues the same canonical query, sort, and group (and, for date-relative queries, the same zone and date) for the same user: it is signed (HMAC-SHA256 over the user id and the payload, keyed by a per-process secret), so another user's cursor, a tampered one, or one from before a restart is `CURSOR_INVALID` too.
- **`total`** is on the first page only, when at most 1000 cards match. `refs` is on the first page only.
- **Relations** (`has:`) follow the per-viewer relation rules (WAVE_13 D105): a relation to a card the caller cannot read counts, one to a readable binned card does not. `has:blocked` counts only readable, live `depends_on` cards outside a done column.
- **Text** uses ASCII case folding (SQLite `lower`), as the Collections query does; accented capitals and accents do not fold here, while the board pipeline and `list_cards` fold accents in JavaScript. Keyset paging needs the match in SQL, so the cross-board query keeps the SQL match.

### Saved views (sub-wave 17C, D140, migration 020)

A view stores a **question, not an answer**: a name, a canonical filter, and display options. Running it always runs the stored filter **as the viewer**, through the same code as `POST /api/tasks/query`, so sharing a view never shows anyone cards from boards they cannot read (T115). Views are configuration, not content: they are not Bin items.

```ts
type TaskView = {
  id; name /* 1–80, trimmed, no control characters */; owner_id; owner_name; is_owner: 0 | 1;
  visibility: "private" | "selected" | "all_users";
  query: string;                                   // canonical grammar
  display: { layout: "list" | "table" | "board"; group: "none" | "board" | "state" | "due" | "assignee" | "tag";
             sort: "due" | "updated" | "created" | "title" | "board";
             fields?: ("board" | "column" | "state" | "assignees" | "due" | "tags" | "flags" | "updated")[] };
  position: number; revision: number; created_at; updated_at;
};
```

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /views` | any | `{ mine, shared, everyone, truncated }`: the caller's views by position; views shared with them (`selected`) and `all_users` views of others, by name, at most 200 each | — |
| `POST /views { name, query, display? }` | any | 201 `{ view }`, private, at the end of the caller's list. `query` is stored canonical; `display` defaults to list, no group, sort by due | 400 (body, `FILTER_*` with `position`), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (50 per owner) |
| `GET /views/:v` | reader | `{ view }` | 404 |
| `PATCH /views/:v { name?, query?, display?, afterViewId?, revision }` | owner | `{ view }` with `revision + 1`. `display` merges into the stored one; `afterViewId` reorders among the owner's views (`null` = first) | 400, 403 `OWNER_ONLY`, 404 (view or anchor), 409 `VIEW_CHANGED` with the current `view` |
| `DELETE /views/:v` | owner | `{ ok: true }` (the client offers Undo by re-creating the same body) | 403, 404 |
| `GET /views/:v/sharing` / `PUT /views/:v/sharing { visibility, userIds ≤ 100 }` | owner | `{ visibility, users: { id, display_name }[] }` / `{ ok: true }`, as board sharing; `PUT` bumps the view's `revision`, so a PATCH with the old one is 409 `VIEW_CHANGED` | 400 (owner as recipient, `selected` without users, unknown or disabled users), 403, 404 |
| `POST /views/:v/duplicate` | reader | 201 `{ view }`: a private copy owned by the caller, named "… (copy)" | 404, 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` |
| `GET /views/:v/cards?cursor&limit&tz` | reader | `{ view, query, cards, nextCursor, total?, refs? }`: the stored filter run as the caller with the view's sort and server-side group (`board`, `state`, `due`; `assignee` and `tag` group on the client) | 400, 404, 429 (shares the query limit) |

- **Readers** are the owner, members for `selected`, and everyone for `all_users`, while the owner is enabled; a disabled owner's views disappear for everyone else. Anyone else gets 404, the same as a missing view. Only the owner edits, reorders, shares, or deletes (403 `OWNER_ONLY`); recipients duplicate instead (§13 Q13).
- **Audit** (ids only): `task.view_create { viewId, sourceViewId? }`, `task.view_update { viewId, renamed?, query?, display?, moved? }`, `task.view_delete`, `task.view_sharing_changed { viewId, visibility, recipientCount }`.

### Column state (sub-wave 17C, D141, migration 020)

Every column has `state: "todo" | "doing" | "done"`, a shared vocabulary across boards for `state:` filters and board lanes. `is_done` stays, and always equals `state = "done"` (T121): the service writes both in one statement.

- The 020 backfill: a done column is `done`; otherwise a board's first column is `todo` and the rest `doing`. New boards get `todo`, `doing`, `done`; a new column is `doing`.
- `PATCH /columns/:c { state? }` (owner) sets the state and `is_done` together. `isDone: true` sets `done`; `isDone: false` on a done column sets `todo` for the board's first column and `doing` otherwise. `isDone` and `state` that disagree are 400. Audit `task.column_state { boardId, columnId, state }` (and `task.column_done` when `isDone` was sent).

## Today (Wave 10)

`GET /api/today?tz=<IANA>&sections=<a,b>?` returns 200 `{ generatedAt, date, sections }`. `date` is today in `tz`. `sections` maps each installed section, in order, to `{ items, more, href }` (at most ten items; `more` when there are more; `href` is the owning app's list). A section whose provider failed is `{ items: [], more: false, href, error }`; the others still load. Sections of modules that are not installed are absent. There are no counts, bodies, or caching. `sections=` limits the response to those names (the per-section Retry).

| Section | Items |
| --- | --- |
| `tasksDue` | `{ cardId, boardId, boardName, title, parentTitle, dueOn, dueTime, dueTz, dueAt, overdue }` (`parentTitle`, 17A: the live parent on the same board, else null): live cards on readable boards, not in a done column, `due_on ≤ date + 7`, soonest first (by `due_on`, then timed cards by wall time, then date-only ones; approximate across zones). A timed card (Wave 13) is `overdue` once `now > dueAt`, a date-only one once `due_on < date` |
| `tasksMine` | as `tasksDue` plus `reason: "assigned" \| "created"`: open cards the caller is one of the assignees of (`card_assignees`, Wave 13) or created |
| `notesRecent` | `{ id, title, owner_name, is_owner, updated_at }`: readable notes; others' notes only once published, with the published title and time |
| `drafts` | `{ id, title, updated_at, neverPublished }`: the caller's notes whose draft differs from the published version, not written by an MCP key |
| `agentDrafts` | `{ id, title, keyName, updated_at }`: the caller's drafts written by an MCP key |
| `files` | `{ id, name, mime_type, preview_kind, size_bytes, owner_name, is_owner, updated_at }`: the Files list, newest first |
| `collectionsRecent` | `{ rowId, collectionId, collectionName, title, updated_at, changedByKey }`: live rows in readable collections, most recently edited first; titles only (`listRecentRows` in `server/collections/service.ts`, which scans only the ten-plus-one most recently updated readable collections, since every row write touches its collection's `updated_at`) |
| `binSoon` | `{ type, id, title, purge_after }`: the caller's Bin items purged within three days |
| `upcoming` | `{ eventId, calendarId, title, start, end, allDay, date }`: occurrences on readable calendars over the next seven local days, not yet ended (Calendar, Wave 12; see § Calendar) |
| `storage` | one item `{ usedBytes, binnedBytes, quotaBytes }`: bytes counted against the quota (live and binned), the binned part, and the quota (`null` = unlimited) |

Errors: 400 when `tz` is not an IANA zone `Intl` accepts (list entries and the aliases browsers still report) or `sections` names an unknown section; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` above 30 requests a minute per user.

## Preferences (Wave 13, D92, D114)

Per-user settings that follow the account across devices. Today they hold only the modules the user turned off in **Settings → Modules** (migration 016, `server/preferences.ts`).

```ts
type ModuleId = "notes" | "files" | "tasks" | "collections" | "calendar" | "search" | "bin" | "notifications" | "team";
type Preferences = { disabledModules: ModuleId[]; revision: number; updatedAt: string | null };
```

- **A hidden module is not a security boundary (T97).** Preferences only hide UI in the web app. Every API route, ACL, MCP tool, calendar feed, reminder, and push keeps working for a module that is turned off, and keeps enforcing its own access rules. MCP never reads preferences, and there is no MCP tool to change them.
- `team` is reserved for Wave 14. Home and Settings are not modules and cannot be turned off.
- A user without a row has every module on: `{ disabledModules: [], revision: 0, updatedAt: null }`. Modules added later start on.
- `disabledModules` is returned unique and in the order above. Ids the server no longer knows are dropped on read.

| Endpoint | Body | Returns | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/preferences` | | 200 `{ preferences }` | |
| `PUT /api/preferences` | `{ disabledModules: ModuleId[], revision }` (strict; unique known ids, at most one per module; `revision` is the one last read, `0` before the first save) | 200 `{ preferences }` with `revision` + 1 (the first save creates revision 1) | 400 for an unknown or repeated id, a missing or negative `revision`, or an extra key. 409 `PREFERENCES_CHANGED` with the current `preferences` when `revision` is stale (compare-and-swap, one writer wins) |

`GET /api/auth/me` adds `preferences: Preferences`, so the app knows which modules to show before its first render. It is served before the TOTP setup gate, like the rest of `/auth/me`; `/api/preferences` is behind it. Each successful PUT is audited as `preferences.update { disabledModules, revision }` (module ids only).

## MCP keys and tools (Wave 8)

### Keys

| Endpoint | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/mcp/keys` | | 200 `{ keys: (McpKey & { effectiveScopes: McpScope[]; binnedToday: number })[] }` (active keys, newest first). `effectiveScopes` are the stored `scopes` narrowed to the owner's current role, so Settings shows a demoted admin's `team:read` as "(admins only, inactive)". `binnedToday` (Wave 19) counts the key's MCP bins in the last 24 hours | |
| `GET /api/mcp/keys/:id/binned?window=1h\|24h\|7d` (Wave 19, D175) | | 200 `{ items: { type: "note" \| "card" \| "event" \| "collection_row", id, title, binnedAt, restorable }[], truncated }`: what the key moved to the Bin in the window (default 24h) and is still in the caller's Bin from that binning, newest first, from `audit_log` rows with the key's `keyId` (at most 500) | 400 (bad window), 404 (not the caller's key) |
| `POST /api/mcp/keys/:id/restore-binned` (Wave 19) | `{ window: "1h" \| "24h" \| "7d" }` | 200 `{ restored: number, skipped: { type, id, reason }[] }`: each item restored through the normal Bin services (the usual owner/binner predicates); `reason` is `not_in_bin`, `parent_in_bin`, `board_in_bin`, `purging`, `limit`, `limit_reached`, or `not_found`. Audited `mcp.key_restore_binned` | 400, 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` (write gate), 404 |
| `POST /api/mcp/keys` (alias of `POST /api/keys` for one release since Wave 31) | `{ name, password, totpCode? \| recoveryCode?, scopes? }` | 201 `{ key: McpKey & { token, userId, prefix, createdAt } }`; the token is shown once | 400 (bad name or scopes), 401 (password or second factor), 403 `SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED` (a scope the caller's team role cannot hold, checked before the password; Wave 14), 409 (10 active keys) |
| `DELETE /api/mcp/keys/:id` | `{}` | 200 `{ ok: true }` | 404 |

```ts
type McpScope = "notes:read" | "notes:write-draft" | "notes:publish" | "files:read" | "files:write" | "tasks:read" | "tasks:write" | "today:read"
  | "calendar:read" | "calendar:write" | "collections:read" | "collections:write" | "bin:write" | "team:read"
  | "inbox:read" | "inbox:write";
type McpKey = { id: string; name: string; key_prefix: string; scopes: McpScope[]; created_at: string; last_used_at: string | null };
```

- `scopes`: unique values (at most one per defined scope), default `["notes:read"]`. A write scope adds its read scope (`notes:write-draft` and `notes:publish` → `notes:read`, `files:write` → `files:read`, `tasks:write` → `tasks:read`, `calendar:write` → `calendar:read`, `collections:write` → `collections:read`, `inbox:write` → `inbox:read`); `bin:write` adds none. Scopes are returned in the order above and cannot be changed later; create a new key instead.
- **Write scopes (Wave 19, D171)** are an explicit list (`MCP_WRITE_SCOPES` in `server/mcpScopes.ts`, mirrored in `src/mcpPermissions.ts`): `notes:write-draft`, `notes:publish`, `files:write`, `tasks:write`, `calendar:write`, `collections:write`, `bin:write`, `inbox:write`. Every other scope is a read scope. Viewers may hold read scopes only, so `POST /api/mcp/keys` answers 403 `SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED` to a viewer asking for any write scope, the three Wave 19 scopes included.
- A tool may also declare `alsoRequires` (all-of, D172): every `bin_*`/`restore_*` tool needs `bin:write` **and** the module's write scope, so `bin:write` alone lists no tools.
- Keys created before migration 010 have `["notes:read"]`.
- The audit row `mcp.key_created` records `{ keyId, name, scopes }`.

### Tools

`/mcp` (outside `/api`) speaks Streamable HTTP with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; transport, key format, Host/Origin checks, and body limits are unchanged. `tools/list` returns only the tools the key's scopes allow, and each handler checks the key again. Tools run as the key's owner.

| Tool | Scope | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_notes` | notes:read | `{ query? }` title filter | `{ notes }`: published notes the owner can read |
| `read_note` | notes:read | `{ noteId }` | `{ id, title, version, markdown }` of the published version |
| `search_notes` | notes:read | `{ query (1–200), folderId?, limit? (1–20, default 10) }` | `{ results: { id, title, snippet, version, folder_id, owner_name, is_owner, updated_at }[], truncated }`. Published text only (never drafts, not even the owner's); the title comes from the published version; snippets are plain text; query rules and live access as in `GET /api/search` |
| `list_folders` | notes:read or files:read | `{}` | `{ folders }` as `GET /api/folders` |
| `create_note` | notes:write-draft | `{ markdown (not blank), folderId? }` | `{ noteId, revision: 1, title, folderId, url }`: a never-published note whose draft is `markdown`, in an owned folder (default: Default) |
| `get_note_draft` | notes:write-draft | `{ noteId }` (owned) | `{ noteId, revision, hasDraft, markdown, publishedVersion, url }`. Without a draft, `revision` is null and `markdown` is the published text |
| `update_note_draft` | notes:write-draft | `{ noteId, markdown, baseRevision: number \| null, mode: "replace" \| "append" }` | `{ noteId, revision, title, hasDelta, url }`. Append adds `markdown` as a new paragraph. Never publishes or creates a version |
| `list_documents` | files:read | `{ folderId? }` | `{ documents: DocumentSummary[] }` as `GET /api/files` |
| `get_document_metadata` | files:read | `{ documentId }` | `{ document: DocumentSummary }` under the Files list predicate |
| `read_document_text` | files:read | `{ documentId }` | `{ id, name, mimeType, sizeBytes, text }` for `preview_kind = 'text'` up to 1 MiB, strict UTF-8 |

| `list_boards` | tasks:read | `{}` | `{ boards }` as `GET /api/tasks/boards` |
| `list_cards` | tasks:read | `{ boardId, columnId?, assigneeIds?, tags?, flags?, dueBefore?, dueAfter?, dueNone?, text? }` | `{ board: { id, name, owner_name, is_owner }, columns: { id, name, position, wip_limit }[], tags: { id, name, color }[], cards: { id, column_id, column_name, position, title, description_preview, revision, creator_name, description_excerpt, due_on, due_time, due_tz, due_at, assignees: string[], assignee_name, tags: string[], flags, comment_count, relation_count, open_blockers, attachments: string[], updated_at }[] }`. `assignees` and `tags` are names in assignment and tagging order (Wave 13); `assignee_name` is the first assignee. `relation_count` and `open_blockers` are computed for the key's owner as in `GET /api/tasks/boards/:b` (13D). `description_preview` is plain text, at most 280 characters; `attachments` are file names only. A `columnId` not on the board is `NOT_FOUND`. **Filters (Wave 13C, D113)** run on the server with bound SQL (`server/tasks/cardQuery.ts`) and mean what the client's `shared/taskQuery.ts` means: values inside one filter are OR-ed and filters are AND-ed. `assigneeIds` (≤ 30): user ids, `"me"` (the key's user), or `"none"` (unassigned); `tags` (≤ 30): names in any case or ids of this board's tags, or `"none"` (untagged), where an unknown tag is `INVALID` with `reason: "UNKNOWN_TAG"`, the unknown `tags`, and the board's `known` names; `flags`: the fixed set or `"none"`; `dueBefore`/`dueAfter`: real dates, exclusive, AND-ed into one range over dated cards (the card's own civil `due_on`); `dueNone: true` adds cards without a date (alone: only those); `text` (1–100): a substring of the title or `description_excerpt`, ignoring case and accents, with no wildcards. The listing keeps the board order |
| `get_card` | tasks:read | `{ cardId }` | `{ card: { id, board_id, board_name, column_id, column_name, title, description, revision, creator_name, description_excerpt, due_on, due_time, due_tz, due_at, assignees: string[], assignee_name, tags: string[], flags, created_at, updated_at }, comments (latest 50, each with `reactions: [{ emoji, glyph, count, reacted }]` and no names, Wave 20), hasMoreComments, attachments: string[], relations: McpRelation[] }`. There is no reaction write tool. `description` is plain text; `relations` resolve for the key's owner exactly as `GET /api/tasks/cards/:k` does, newest first (13D) |
| `list_children` | tasks:read | `{ cardId }` | `{ children: { id, title, level, level_name, column_id, column_name, is_done, due_on, child_count, done_child_count }[] }`: live direct children by column, then position, at most 100, always on the card's own board. `NOT_FOUND` for a card the owner cannot read (17A, D139) |
| `search_cards` | tasks:read | `{ query (1–100, trimmed), boardId?, limit? (1–20, default 20) }` | `{ results: { id, board_id, board_name, title, column_name, is_done }[], truncated }` as `GET /api/tasks/cards/search`: titles only, live cards on boards the owner can read, `boardId` first (a hint). Not rate-limited beyond the per-key call limits (13D) |
| (hierarchy, 17A) | | | Every card `list_cards`, `get_card`, `create_card`, and `update_card` return adds `parent_id`, `level`, `level_name`, `child_count`, and `done_child_count`; `list_cards`'s `board` adds `levels` (names, top first) and `work_level`; `get_card` adds `card.parent_title` and `children` (as `list_children`); `query_cards` cards add `parent_id`, `parent_title`, and `level`, and its filter takes `parent:`, `level:`, and `has:subtasks`. `create_card` and `update_card` take `parentId` and `level` with the REST rules (§ Hierarchy): an invalid parent is `INVALID` with `reason: "PARENT_INVALID"`, a level change on a card with children `INVALID` with `reason: "HAS_CHILDREN"` and `childCount`; audited like the REST writes with `{ via: "mcp", keyId }` in the `task_write` bucket. No structure or sprint tools (D139, T119) |
| `list_sprints` (17B) | `tasks:read` | read | `{ boardId, state?: "planned" \| "active" \| "completed", cursor? }` → `{ sprints: { id, name, goal, state, is_active, start_on, end_on, completed_at, card_count, done_count }[], nextCursor }`: the active sprint, planned ones in order, then completed ones newest first (20 a page); `NOT_FOUND` for a board the user cannot read. Every card `list_cards`, `get_card`, `create_card`, and `update_card` return adds `sprint_id` (inherited below the work level) and `sprint_name`; `list_cards` takes `sprint: "current" \| "next" \| "none" \| <sprintId>` and its `board` adds `sprints_enabled` and, when set, `sprint_defaults: { days, start, name_pattern }` (read-only; the owner changes them in the app); `query_cards` cards add `sprint_id` and `sprint_name`, and its filter takes `sprint:`. `create_card` and `update_card` take `sprintId` (nullable) with the REST rules (§ Sprints; an omitted `sprintId` on `create_card`, or on a `card_create` proposal when it is approved, puts a work-level card in the active sprint, `null` in the backlog): below the work level `INVALID` with `reason: "SPRINT_LEVEL"`, a completed sprint `INVALID` with `reason: "SPRINT_COMPLETED"`, an unknown or other board's sprint `NOT_FOUND`; audited with `{ via: "mcp", keyId }` in the `task_write` bucket. Wave 19 adds owner-only `create_sprint` and `start_sprint`; there is still no complete or delete tool: completing a sprint stays with a person |
| `list_views` | tasks:read | `{}` | `{ views: { id, name, owner_name, is_owner, visibility, query }[] }`: the owner's views, views shared with them, and `all_users` views, as `GET /api/tasks/views` (17C) |
| `query_cards` | tasks:read | `{ viewId? \| filter? (grammar, ≤ 2000), sort?, group? (with filter only), cursor?, limit? (1–50, default 50), tz? (IANA, default UTC) }`, exactly one of `viewId` and `filter` | `{ view?: { id, name, owner_name }, query, cards: { id, board_id, board_name, column_id, column_name, state, title, description_excerpt, revision, creator_name, due_on, due_time, due_tz, due_at, assignees: string[], assignee_name, tags: string[], flags, updated_at }[], nextCursor, total?, refs? }`. The same service as `POST /api/tasks/query` and `GET /api/tasks/views/:v/cards`, as the key's owner: a view or filter never reaches a board they cannot read, and such ids resolve as `restricted` in `refs`. Grammar errors are `INVALID` with `reason` (`FILTER_INVALID`, `FILTER_UNSUPPORTED`, `FILTER_SCOPE`, `CURSOR_INVALID`) and `position`; a view the owner cannot read is `NOT_FOUND`. Read bucket only, not audited, no REST query limit; there are no view write tools (17C, D145) |
| `create_card` | tasks:write | `{ boardId, columnId, title, description?, dueOn?, dueTime?, dueTz?, assigneeIds? (≤ 20), tags? (≤ 10), flags?, parentId?, level?, afterCardId? }` | `{ card: { id, board_id, column_id, title, revision, description_excerpt, due_on, due_time, due_tz, due_at, assignees: string[], assignee_name, tags: string[], flags } }`. `afterCardId` omitted = bottom, `null` = top. Same validation as `POST /api/tasks/boards/:b/cards`; a full column is `COLUMN_FULL`. `tags` are **existing** tags of the board by name (any case) or id; an unknown one is `INVALID` with `reason: "UNKNOWN_TAG"` and nothing is written (MCP never creates tags) |
| `update_card` | tasks:write | `{ cardId, baseRevision, title?, dueOn?, dueTime?, dueTz?, assigneeIds?, tags?, flags?, parentId? (uuid or null), level? }` (no other keys) | `{ card }` as `create_card` returns it, with `revision + 1`. Same validation as `PATCH /api/tasks/cards/:k`: `dueOn: null` clears the date and time, `dueTime: null` only the time, `assigneeIds`, `tags` (existing tags of the card's board, by name or id, as for `create_card`), and `flags` each replace the set, and `[]` clears it. **Never changes the description** (a `description` key is `INVALID`, §11 Q8). `CARD_CHANGED` with `currentRevision` when `baseRevision` is stale. Wave 13 |
| `move_card` | tasks:write | `{ cardId, columnId, afterCardId? }` | `{ card: { id, column_id, position } }`. Same board only; `afterCardId` omitted = bottom, `null` = top; moving into another column at its WIP limit is `COLUMN_FULL` |
| `link_cards` | tasks:write | `{ cardId, targetCardId, type: RelationType }` (no other keys) | `{ relation: McpRelation }` seen from `cardId`. Same service as `POST /api/tasks/cards/:k/relations`: both cards must be readable (`NOT_FOUND` otherwise, identical to a missing id), one relation per pair (`RELATION_EXISTS` with the existing `relation`), 50 per card (`LIMIT_REACHED`); never changes either card's revision. There is no unlink tool (13D) |
| `comment_on_card` | tasks:write | `{ cardId, body }` | `{ comment: { id, card_id, created_at } }`, authored by the key's owner |
| `get_today` | today:read | `{ tz? }` (IANA, default UTC) | The `GET /api/today` body, titles and ids only, with only the sections the key may read (T74): task sections need `tasks:read`, `notesRecent`/`drafts`/`agentDrafts` need `notes:read`, `files` needs `files:read`, `collectionsRecent` needs `collections:read`, `upcoming` needs `calendar:read`; `binSoon` and `storage` need `today:read` alone, and `binSoon` keeps only item types the key may read (notes: `notes:read`, documents: `files:read`, cards and boards: `tasks:read`, collections and rows: `collections:read`, calendars and events: `calendar:read`). It shares the 30-a-minute per-user Today limit (`RATE_LIMITED` with `retryAfterSeconds`). `list_cards` and `get_card` also return `due_on` and `assignee_name` |
| `list_calendars` | calendar:read | `{}` | `{ calendars: { id, name, role, color, ownerName }[] }` as `GET /api/calendars` (a first call creates "Personal", as there) |
| `list_events` | calendar:read | `{ from, to, calendarIds? (≤ 50), tz? }` (dates, `to` exclusive, at most 100 days) | `{ occurrences: { eventId, calendarId, title, location, start, end, allDay, recurring, date }[], truncated }` as `GET /api/events` |
| `get_event` | calendar:read | `{ eventId }` | `{ event: { id, calendarId, calendarName, title, description, location, allDay, start, end, tz, durationMinutes, repeat, exdates, updatedAt }, revision, role, links, url }`. `description` is plain text; `links` are `{ targetType, targetId, title }` or `{ targetType, restricted: true }` (the owner cannot read the target, or the key lacks its module's read grant or has it only for other boards or collections, T203) |
| `create_event` | calendar:write | `{ calendarId, title, allDay, start, end?, durationMinutes?, tz?, repeat?, description?, location? }` | `{ eventId, revision: 1, url }`. All-day: `start`/`end` are dates (`end` exclusive, default the next day). Timed: `start` is local `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM` in `tz`, with `durationMinutes` or a local `end`. Editor role; validated by the `POST /api/calendars/:k/events` schema |
| `update_event` | calendar:write | `{ eventId, baseRevision, title?, allDay?, start?, end?, durationMinutes?, tz?, repeat?, description?, location? }` | `{ eventId, revision, url }` or `EVENT_CHANGED` with `currentRevision`. Undoable in the app |
| `create_reminder` | calendar:write | `{ eventId, offsetMinutes, tz? }` or `{ title, fireAt, tz? }` (`tz` default UTC) | `{ reminderId, nextFireAt, eventId }`, always for the key's owner; viewers may set reminders on events they can read |
| `list_collections` | collections:read | `{}` | `{ collections: { id, name, role, rowCount, ownerName, fields: { id, name, type, required?, unit?, decimals?, options?: { id, label }[] }[] }[] }` |
| `query_rows` | collections:read | `{ collectionId, filters?: { field, op, value? }[] (≤ 10), sort?: { field, direction? }[] (≤ 3), q?, limit? (1–50, default 20), cursor? }` | `{ rows: McpRow[], total, nextCursor }`. `field` is a field name or id; select values may be labels. Operators and cursors as `POST /api/collections/:c/query` |
| `get_row` | collections:read | `{ rowId }` | `{ row: McpRow, revision, role, collectionName }` |
| `create_row` | collections:write | `{ collectionId, values }` | `{ rowId, revision: 1, url }`. Editor role; the row goes at the bottom |
| `update_row` | collections:write | `{ rowId, values, baseRevision }` | `{ rowId, revision, url }` or `ROW_CHANGED` with `currentRevision`. Values merge; `null` clears a field |

**Wave 19 write tools** (WAVES_18-20_SMALL.md §2.3). "+ bin:write" means the tool also requires `bin:write` (all-of, D172); `bin:write` alone lists none of them. All are writes (the per-minute `write` bucket) except `finish_upload`. Bin tools never purge; there is no purge, empty-Bin, sharing, role, key, or sprint-completion tool (`tests/mcpRules.test.ts`).

| Tool | Scope | Bucket | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `publish_note_draft` | notes:publish | `note_publish` | `{ noteId, revision }` (owned) | `{ noteId, version, publishedAt, audience: "private" \| "shared", url }`. The revision must be one this key was shown by `create_note`, `get_note_draft`, or `update_note_draft` (the D173 ledger: `DRAFT_NOT_SEEN` otherwise, also after a restart); a draft changed since is `DRAFT_CHANGED`; `NO_DRAFT`, `NO_CHANGES`. Runs `publishDraft` (the HTTP route's service); clears `draft_mcp_key_id`; audited `note.publish { version, via, keyId }` |
| `get_note_draft` | notes:write-draft **or** notes:publish | – | unchanged | unchanged; records the returned revision in the key's ledger |
| `create_folder` | notes:write-draft or files:write | `structure_write` | `{ name, parentId? }` | `{ folder: { id, parent_id, name, created_at, updated_at } }`, always private (no cascade). `NAME_TAKEN` for Default; a parent not owned is `NOT_FOUND`. Shares `createFolder` with `POST /api/folders`; audited `folder.create` |
| `bin_note` / `restore_note` | notes:write-draft + bin:write | `bin_action` + `bin_burst` / – | `{ noteId }` (owned) | `{ noteId, binned: true, purgeAfter }` (a blank note is binned too, never purged) / `{ noteId, restored: true, alreadyRestored?, folderId, folderName, visibility, url }`; `PURGING` |

| `manage_tags` | tasks:write | `task_write` | `{ boardId, action: "create" \| "rename" \| "recolour", tagId?, name?, color? }` | `{ tag: { id, name, color } }`. Anyone at edit creates (`READ_ONLY` below it since Wave 32; `NAME_TAKEN` for an existing name in any case); rename and recolour are the board owner's only through a key, managers included (`OWNER_ONLY`, D265, T145), and change only their own field; a tag of another board is `NOT_FOUND`. No delete |
| `set_wip_limit` | tasks:write | `task_write` | `{ columnId, wipLimit: 1–1000 \| null }` | `{ column: { id, name, wip_limit } }`; the board owner only, managers included (`OWNER_ONLY`; managers set it in the web app) |
| `create_sprint` | tasks:write | `sprint_write` | `{ boardId, name, goal?, startOn?, endOn? }` | `{ sprint: { id, name, goal, state, start_on, end_on } }`; the board owner only, managers included (`OWNER_ONLY`); `INVALID` with `reason: "SPRINTS_OFF"`. An omitted `startOn` is today (UTC) and an omitted `endOn` is the board's default sprint length after the start (`sprintDefaults.days`, else 14), so a sprint an agent starts has dates (v0.11.0 1l); `null` keeps a date empty |
| `start_sprint` | tasks:write | `sprint_write` | `{ sprintId }` | `{ sprint: { id, name, state, is_active, start_on, end_on } }`; the board owner only, managers included (`OWNER_ONLY`); `SPRINT_ACTIVE` with `activeSprintId`. There is no `complete_sprint` (director review) |
| `link_attachment` | tasks:write | `task_write` | `{ cardId, documentId, commentId? }` | `{ attachment: { cardId, documentId, name, commentId }, alreadyLinked }`. Only the caller's own live `task_attachment` documents (T41); a Files document is `NOT_FOUND`. Idempotent |
| `bin_event` / `restore_event` | calendar:write + bin:write | `bin_action` + `bin_burst` / – | `{ eventId }` | `{ eventId, binned: true, purgeAfter }` / `{ eventId, restored: true, alreadyRestored?, calendarId, url }`; `PARENT_IN_BIN` when its calendar is binned |
| `create_collection` | collections:write | `row_write` | `{ name, icon?, templateId? \| fields? }` (exactly one) | `{ collectionId, name, fields: { id, name, type }[], url }`, private; the route schema (`__proto__` refused), `SCHEMA_LIMITS`, and 100 per owner (`LIMIT_REACHED`) |

**`PUT /mcp/uploads/:uploadId`** (Wave 19, D176; outside `/api`, no cookie or CSRF): the `/mcp` Host and Origin checks, `Authorization: Bearer` with the key that called `begin_upload` (with `files:write` effective and a write role), `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`, and `Content-Length` equal to `sizeBytes`. The raw body streams through the web upload's pipeline (`storeRawUpload` → `commitReceived` in `server/documents.ts`) with the ticket id as the idempotency key. Answers 201 `{ document }`, 200 `{ document, idempotentReplay: true }` on a retry, 400 (`SIZE_MISMATCH`, `HASH_MISMATCH` — the ticket then fails — or a wrong type), 401 (invalid key, or the owner blocked), 403 `SCOPE_REQUIRED`, 404 (unknown, another key's, or `UPLOAD_EXPIRED`), 408 `UPLOAD_TIMEOUT`, 409 (in progress or failed), 411 `LENGTH_REQUIRED`, 413, 429 `TOO_MANY_UPLOADS`, 507 `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` / `DISK_FULL`.

Task tools call the `/api/tasks` services as the key's owner, so the W9 rules apply unchanged (since Wave 32 with levels: card writes need edit, comments need comment, both `READ_ONLY` below; structure tools stay the board owner's through a key even for managers, `OWNER_ONLY`, D265, T145): any board reader (owner, member, everyone on an `all_users` board) may create, update, move, and comment; a board the user cannot read, and every id on it, is `NOT_FOUND`, identical to a missing id. There are no tools that edit descriptions or delete cards, or that change columns (other than their WIP limit, owner only), sharing, or boards; binning needs `bin:write` too (Wave 19). `ASSIGNEE_NOT_MEMBER` and the due-time rules are `INVALID` (with `reason` when the service gave a code). A stale `afterCardId` returns `STALE_POSITION` with `columnId` and the column's current `order`; `LIMIT_REACHED` passes through the board and relation caps. There is no tool to unlink cards. Task writes are audited through the usual `task.card_create`, `task.card_update`, `task.card_move`, `task.comment_create`, and `task.relation_create` events with `{ via: "mcp", keyId }` added.

```ts
// Relations as agents see them, from the card they asked about (T90).
type McpRelation =
  | { type: RelationType; cardId: string; title: string; boardName: string; columnName: string | null; isDone: boolean }
  | { type: RelationType; restricted: true };   // a card the key's owner cannot read, or the key may not (below): nothing else
```

**Foreign items and key grants (T203).** Anything a tool shows about an item other than the one the call names (a relation's other card, an event link's target, a collection `note` field's note) needs the key to hold that target's module read grant (`tasks:read`, `calendar:read`, `collections:read`, `notes:read`; a write grant implies it), and, when that grant names chosen boards or collections, the target must lie inside one of them. Otherwise the item comes back in the module's usual restricted shape (`{ type, restricted: true }` for relations, `{ targetType, restricted: true }` for event links, `{ restricted: true }` for note fields): no id, title, board, column, or done flag. The shape is identical to "the key's owner cannot read it", so it discloses nothing about which check failed. `create_row` and `update_row` pointing a `note` field at a note the key may not read are `NOT_FOUND`, like a missing note; clearing the field is always allowed. Proposal approvals run as the approving person, so the key's grants do not narrow them (`server/keyReach.ts`).

Calendar tools call the `/api/calendars`, `/api/events`, and `/api/reminders` services, and collection tools the `/api/collections` services, as the key's owner (D70, T72–T75). Readers read; only the owner and editors write (a viewer gets `READ_ONLY`); anything the user cannot read, including binned items, is `NOT_FOUND`. Writes are create and update only: there are no delete, exdate, share, feed, schema, view, attachment, or import tools. Every write sets `updated_via_key_id` (the event view's and row panel's "Changed by <key>", with Undo), is audited through the usual `event.create`, `event.update`, `reminder.create`, `collection.row_create`, and `collection.row_update` events with `{ via: "mcp", keyId }` added, and counts against the daily buckets below. A person's own edit or undo clears the key mark.

```ts
// Rows as agents see them: keyed by field name.
type McpRow = {
  id: string; collectionId: string; title: string;
  values: Record<string, string | number | boolean | string[]   // select → label, multi_select → labels, file → attachment names
    | { noteId: string; title: string } | { restricted: true }>;  // note fields; restricted without notes:read too (T203)
  revision: number; updatedAt: string; updatedBy: string | null;
  changedByKey: string | null;   // the key's name when the last change came through MCP
  url: string;                   // <origin>/collections/<c>/row/<r>
};
```

Collection `values` are keyed by field name (or id), with select options as labels (case-insensitive) or ids; unknown fields and file fields are `INVALID` with `fieldErrors` keyed by name, and the service's strict validation (types, required fields, readable note links, 16 KiB) applies unchanged. Field names `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` are refused by schema validation (400 `INVALID_SCHEMA`), since name-keyed inputs drop or refuse such keys; a collection that already has one still presents it as an ordinary key (row `values` objects have no prototype), and agents write it by field id.

Errors are tool results with `isError: true` whose text is `{ error, code, ...details }`:

| Code | When |
| --- | --- |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Missing, not readable, not owned (draft tools), binned, or not a Files document; all look the same |
| `INVALID` | Arguments fail validation (the transport may also reject them before the tool runs) |
| `SCOPE_REQUIRED` | The key lacks the tool's scope, or was revoked meanwhile |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Per key: 120 calls and 30 writes per minute; per day 200 `create_note`, 500 task writes, 200 event writes (`create_event`, `update_event`), 100 `create_reminder`, and 500 row writes (`create_row`, `update_row`). Per user across keys: 1000 calls and 60 writes per minute; per day 400 `create_note`, 1000 task writes, 400 event writes, 200 reminders, and 1000 row writes. Wave 19, per key (per user): `note_publish` 50 (100) a day, `bin_action` 50 (100) a day, `bin_burst` 10 (20) a minute, `sprint_write` 20 (40), `structure_write` 100 (200), and `file_write` 100 (200) a day. Includes `retryAfterSeconds` |
| `DRAFT_CHANGED` | `baseRevision` is not the current draft revision. Includes `currentRevision` |
| `STALE_POSITION` | `afterCardId` is not a live card in the target column. Includes `columnId` and the column's current `order` |
| `LIMIT_REACHED` | A module cap (cards per board, comments per card, events per calendar, reminders per event, rows per collection) |
| `READ_ONLY` | A viewer called a write tool on a calendar or collection shared read-only |
| `EVENT_CHANGED` | `update_event`'s `baseRevision` is not the event's revision. Includes `currentRevision` |
| `CARD_CHANGED` | `update_card`'s `baseRevision` is not the card's revision. Includes `currentRevision` only |
| `COLUMN_FULL` | `create_card` or `move_card` (from another column) into a column at its WIP limit. Includes `columnId`, `wipLimit`, and `cardCount` |
| `RELATION_EXISTS` | `link_cards` on two cards that already have a relation (either direction, any type). Includes the existing `relation` seen from `cardId` |
| `ROW_CHANGED` | `update_row`'s `baseRevision` is not the row's revision. Includes `currentRevision` |
| `REMINDER_EXISTS` | The key's owner already has a reminder at that offset on the event |
| `SCHEMA_CHANGED` | A `query_rows` cursor was issued before the collection's fields changed; start again without it |
| `NOT_TEXT` | Not a text file, or not valid UTF-8 |
| `TOO_LARGE` | Text file over 1 MiB, or Markdown over `MAX_MARKDOWN_BYTES` |
| `NO_DRAFT`, `NO_CHANGES` | `publish_note_draft`: there is no draft, or it matches the published version |
| `DRAFT_NOT_SEEN` | `publish_note_draft`: this key was not shown that revision (read it with `get_note_draft`) |
| `PURGING` | The item is being permanently deleted |
| `PARENT_IN_BIN` | A restore whose board, calendar, or collection is itself in the Bin |
| `AUDIENCE_CHANGE` | `move_file` would change who can see the file |
| `NAME_TAKEN` | `create_folder` "Default", or `manage_tags` with a name that exists |
| `SPRINT_ACTIVE` | `start_sprint` while another sprint is active. Includes `activeSprintId` |
| `UPLOAD_PENDING`, `UPLOAD_EXPIRED`, `HASH_MISMATCH` | `finish_upload` states |
| `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | The storage quota (or free disk) cannot fit the file |
| `INTERNAL` | Integrity or server failure |

Note writes are audited as `mcp.note_create` and `mcp.note_draft_update` (`{ via: "mcp", keyId, mode?, revision? }`), task writes as their usual `task.*` events with `{ via: "mcp", keyId }` added; reads are not audited.

### Note fields for MCP drafts

- `GET /api/notes` rows gain `draft_mcp_key_name: string | null` (owner only, while a draft exists).
- `GET /api/notes/:id` gains `draftMcpKeyName: string | null` (owner only); `draft_mcp_key_id` is never returned.
- `POST /api/notes/:id/publish` takes `{ revision }`, the draft revision the client last saw; the app always sends it. A different revision returns 409 `{ code: "DRAFT_CHANGED", currentRevision }` and publishes nothing. Omitting it is allowed only when no MCP key wrote the draft (older clients); otherwise 400.
- Publishing, discarding the draft, and restoring a version to the draft clear `notes.draft_mcp_key_id`. A human autosave keeps it, because the draft still holds the key's text.

## Collections (Wave 11)

Typed tables ([WAVES_10-12.md](WAVES_10-12.md) §3). Every endpoint is under `/api/collections`, takes and returns JSON (except CSV export), and inherits the global session, Origin, CSRF, `Content-Type: application/json`, and TOTP rules. Path ids are UUIDs (400 otherwise). Request bodies containing `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype` keys at any depth are rejected with 400.

### Schema

```ts
type FieldType = "text" | "number" | "date" | "checkbox" | "select" | "multi_select" | "url" | "note" | "file";
type SelectOption = { id: string /* o_[a-z0-9]{6} */; label: string /* 1–60, unique per field, case-insensitive */; color: "gray" | "red" | "orange" | "yellow" | "green" | "teal" | "blue" | "purple" | "pink" };
type FieldDefinition = {
  id: string;                          // f_[a-z0-9]{8}, generated by the server
  name: string;                        // 1–60 characters, unique case-insensitive
  type: FieldType;
  required?: true;                     // never on file fields
  number?: { decimals: number /* 0–6 */; unit: string /* ≤ 8 */ };   // number fields only
  options?: SelectOption[];            // select and multi_select only, ≤ 100
};
type CollectionSchema = { fields: FieldDefinition[] };   // 1–50 fields; fields[0] is text (the primary field, the row title); ≤ 65,536 bytes
type FieldInput = Omit<FieldDefinition, "id" | "options" | "required"> & { id?: string; required?: boolean; options?: Array<{ id?: string; label: string; color?: string }> };
```

- Ids are assigned by the server. An input `id` must name a field (or option) that already exists; fields and options without one are new.
- Allowed type changes: text ↔ url and select → multi_select. Anything else is 400 `INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE_CHANGE`; other schema errors are 400 `INVALID_SCHEMA`.

**Values** are keyed by field id. Writes are strict (400 `INVALID_VALUES { fieldErrors: { [fieldId]: message } }`); reads are lenient (values of removed fields or options, or of a now-incompatible type, read as empty and are dropped on the next write). `null` or an empty value clears a field.

| Type | Stored value |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | string ≤ 4000 characters: NFC, CRLF → LF, controls (other than tab and newline) and bidi overrides stripped, trimmed |
| `number` | finite JSON number |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD`, a real calendar date |
| `checkbox` | `true` (false clears) |
| `select` | one option id |
| `multi_select` | ≤ 20 distinct option ids |
| `url` | `http:` or `https:` URL, ≤ 2048 characters |
| `note` | a note uuid the writer can read at write time |
| `file` | never stored; derived from attachment links |

A row's values JSON is at most 16,384 bytes. Required fields must be set on create and cannot be cleared.

**Templates** (`GET /templates`): `inventory`, `subscriptions`, `expenses`, `recipes`, `contacts`. A template's fields are copied into the new collection with fresh ids.

### Roles

A collection's readers are its owner, its members and groups when `visibility = 'selected'`, and every user when `visibility = 'all_users'`. Since Wave 32 each member and group has its own level (view, edit, manage), and `share_role` (`viewer` or `editor`, D54) is the level of the `all_users` audience; editors create, edit, undo, and bin rows, and managers edit the name, icon, schema, and views (see "Groups, levels, and item access"). Only the owner uses the `/sharing` route and deletes. A caller who cannot read the collection gets **404** on every route (path ids are always joined to their collection); a viewer writing a row gets **403** `READ_ONLY`; a non-manager changing the structure gets **403** `MANAGER_REQUIRED`, and a non-owner calling an owner-only route **403** `OWNER_ONLY`. Binned collections and rows are unreadable for everyone.

**Caps** (409 `LIMIT_REACHED`): 100 live collections per owner, 10,000 live rows per collection, 20 views per collection, 20 attachments per row.

```ts
type CollectionSummary = {
  id: string; name: string /* 1–120 */; icon: string /* [a-z0-9-]{1,32} */;
  owner_id: string; owner_name: string; is_owner: 0 | 1;
  role: "owner" | "editor" | "viewer";
  visibility: Visibility; share_role: "viewer" | "editor";
  row_count: number; field_count: number; template_id: string | null;
  created_at: string; updated_at: string;
};
type CollectionDetail = CollectionSummary & { fields: FieldDefinition[]; schema_version: number };
type NoteLink = { id: string; title: string } | { id: string; restricted: true };
type RowSummary = {
  id: string; collection_id: string; position: number;
  title: string;                          // the primary field's text
  values: Record<string, FieldValue>;     // lenient read against the current schema
  links: Record<string, NoteLink>;        // note fields, resolved for the caller (never an unreadable title)
  revision: number; can_undo: boolean;
  created_by: string | null; created_by_name: string | null; updated_by_name: string | null;
  updated_via_key_id: string | null;      // set by MCP writes (Stage E); cleared by a person's edit or undo
  updated_via_key_name: string | null;    // that key's name while it exists ("Changed by <key>")
  created_at: string; updated_at: string;
};
```

### Collections and rows

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /` | any | 200 `{ collections: CollectionSummary[] }`: owned first, then shared, each by name (limit 500) | |
| `GET /templates` | any | 200 `{ templates: [{ id, name, icon, description, fields: [{ name, type }] }] }` | |
| `POST / { name, icon?, templateId?, fields? }` | any | 201 `{ collection: CollectionDetail }`. Neither `templateId` nor `fields` gives Name + Notes. | 400 (`INVALID_SCHEMA`, unknown template, both given), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` |
| `GET /:c` | reader | 200 `{ collection, role, views }` | 404 |
| `PATCH /:c { name?, icon? }` | owner | 200 `{ collection }` | 400, 403, 404 |
| `DELETE /:c` | owner | 200 `{ ok: true, purgeAfter }`: to the Bin with its rows | 403, 404 |
| `PUT /:c/schema { fields: FieldInput[], schemaVersion }` | owner | 200 `{ collection }` with `schema_version + 1` | 400 `INVALID_SCHEMA` / `INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE_CHANGE`, 403, 404, 409 `{ code: "SCHEMA_CHANGED", collection }` |
| `POST /:c/query { viewId?, sort?, filters?, q?, cursor?, limit? }` | reader | 200 `{ rows: RowSummary[], nextCursor: string \| null, schemaVersion, total }` | 400 `INVALID_QUERY` / `INVALID_CURSOR`, 404, 409 `SCHEMA_CHANGED` |
| `POST /:c/rows { values, afterRowId? }` | editor | 201 `{ row }`. Omitted `afterRowId` = bottom, `null` = top. | 400 `INVALID_VALUES`, 403 `READ_ONLY`, 404 (collection, or an anchor not in it), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` |
| `GET /rows/:r` | reader | 200 `{ row, role, schemaVersion }` | 404 |
| `PATCH /rows/:r { values, revision }` | editor | 200 `{ row }`: `values` is merged; `revision + 1`; the previous values are kept for undo | 400, 403, 404, 409 `{ code: "ROW_CHANGED", row }` |
| `POST /rows/:r/undo { revision }` | editor | 200 `{ row }`: the previous values, projected onto the current schema; undo is one step | 403, 404, 409 `ROW_CHANGED` or `NOTHING_TO_UNDO`. An undo of an attach or unlink follows those routes' rules for the caller: every link it puts back must be to a document the caller owns, and every link it removes must be the caller's own unless the caller owns the collection; otherwise the whole undo is refused with 403 `{ code: "NOT_LINKER", documentIds }` and nothing changes |
| `DELETE /rows/:r` | editor | 200 `{ ok: true, purgeAfter }`: to the Bin | 403, 404 |

### Saved views

```ts
type ViewConfig = { sort?: SortSpec[] /* ≤ 3 */; filters?: FilterSpec[] /* ≤ 10 */; hiddenFieldIds?: string[] /* never the primary field */ };
type CollectionView = { id: string; collection_id: string; name: string /* 1–60 */; kind: "table"; config: ViewConfig; position: number; created_at: string; updated_at: string };
```

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /:c/views { name, kind?: "table", config }` | owner | 201 `{ view }` (appended) | 400 `INVALID_QUERY` (config does not compile against the schema, unknown hidden field) or over 8 KiB, 403, 404, 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (20) |
| `PATCH /views/:v { name?, config? }` | owner | 200 `{ view }` | 400, 403, 404 |
| `DELETE /views/:v` | owner | 200 `{ ok: true }` | 403, 404 |

Views are listed by `GET /:c` for every reader and used through `POST /:c/query { viewId }`; a view id from another collection is 404. `q` is never stored. `kind: "board"` is reserved. Audit: `collection.view_create`, `collection.view_update`, `collection.view_delete` with `{ collectionId, viewId }`.

### Row attachments

`file` values are derived from links (D58): `RowSummary.files` is `{ [fieldId]: AttachmentSummary[] }` with `AttachmentSummary = { id, name, mime_type, preview_kind, size_bytes, linked_by, created_at }`, live documents only. Uploads for rows use `POST /api/files?purpose=collection_attachment` (no `folderId`, 400 otherwise): the document is stored with `folder_id = NULL`, counts against the uploader's quota, and never appears in `GET /api/files`, folder counts, or the Files Bin filter.

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /rows/:r/attachments { documentId, fieldId }` | editor that owns the document | 201 `{ row }` | 400 (not a file field), 403 `READ_ONLY`, 404 (row, or a document that is not the caller's live `file` or `collection_attachment` document), 409 `ALREADY_ATTACHED` / `LIMIT_REACHED` (20 per row) |
| `DELETE /rows/:r/attachments/:d` | editor who linked it, or the owner | 200 `{ row, documentBinned }` | 403 `READ_ONLY` / `NOT_LINKER`, 404 |

- **Access.** A linked document is readable (`GET /api/files/:id`, `/content`) by anyone who can read a live row that links it in a live collection; the check is live, so unsharing, binning the row or collection, or unlinking ends access at once (T58). This path is OR-ed into `readableDocument*` only, never into lists.
- **Files routes.** Rename, move, and sharing (`PATCH /api/files/:id`, `GET|PUT /api/files/:id/sharing`) are 404 for any document whose `purpose` is not `file`, and sharing rows or folder access never apply to such documents. `DELETE /api/files/:id` on a row attachment that a row still links is 409 `ATTACHMENT_LINKED`.
- **Never linked.** The hourly sweeper moves `collection_attachment` uploads with no row link that are older than 24 hours to the uploader's Bin (100 per run, `deleted_by = NULL`, audit reason `attachment_never_linked`).
- **Lifecycle.** When the last link to a `collection_attachment` document is removed (unlink, or a row or collection purge), the document moves to the uploader's Bin (`deleted_by` = actor). Files items that were linked are never binned. Restoring an attachment from the Bin keeps `folder_id = NULL`.
- **Notes** in `note` fields never grant access: a note the caller cannot read resolves as `{ id, restricted: true }` (T59).
- Audit: `collection.row_attach` and `collection.row_detach` with `{ collectionId, rowId, documentId }`; a binned upload adds `document.delete { documentId, reason: "attachment_unlinked" }`.

### CSV import and export

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /:c/import { csv, mapping?, dryRun }` | editor | dry run: 200 `{ dryRun: true, header, total, valid, errorCount, errors ≤ 50, mapping, preview ≤ 20, wouldExceedLimit }`; import: 200 `{ inserted }` | 400 `INVALID_CSV` (with `line`) / `INVALID_MAPPING` / `IMPORT_INVALID { errorCount, errors }`, 403 `READ_ONLY`, 404, 409 `LIMIT_REACHED`, 413 `IMPORT_TOO_LARGE`, 429 `RATE_LIMITED` |
| `GET /:c/export.csv?viewId=` | reader | 200 `text/csv; charset=utf-8`, `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `no-store` | 400 (bad `viewId`), 404 (collection, or a view of another collection) |

- **Import** (D59, T56). `csv` is the file's text inside JSON, at most 2,000,000 UTF-8 bytes; the first record is the header, then at most 5000 rows of at most 50 columns (in-house RFC 4180 parser: quotes, doubled quotes, embedded line breaks, CRLF/LF/CR, BOM stripped, empty records skipped). `mapping` has one entry per header column: a field id or `null` to skip; without it, columns map to fields with the same name (case-insensitive). File fields cannot be mapped. Cells convert per type (numbers may use `,` separators; checkboxes accept yes/no/true/false/1/0/x; options match by label or id, several separated by `;`; notes by id and must be readable), then pass the same strict validation as `POST /rows`. `errors[].row` counts data rows from 1. A real import inserts every row in one transaction, indexed for search, or nothing; imports count five per minute per user, dry runs included. Audit: `collection.import { collectionId, count }`.
- **Export** (T55). The rows `POST /:c/query { viewId }` returns (all pages, in order) and the view's shown fields, as UTF-8 with a BOM and CRLF. Text cells (names, text, url, option labels, note titles, file names) that start with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, or CR get a leading `'`; numbers, dates, and checkboxes are written as-is. Note titles follow the caller's access (empty when unreadable). Importing an export removes the added `'`. Audit: `collection.export { collectionId, count }`.

### Collection sharing

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /:c/sharing` | owner | 200 `{ visibility, role: "viewer" \| "editor", users: [{ id, display_name }] }` | 403 `OWNER_ONLY`, 404 |
| `PUT /:c/sharing { visibility: "private" \| "selected" \| "all_users", userIds ≤ 100, role? = "viewer" }` | owner | 200 `{ ok: true }` | 400, 403, 404 |

Same rules as board sharing: the owner cannot be a recipient (400), `selected` needs at least one user (400), every user must exist and be enabled (400), and member rows are kept only for `selected`. `role` applies to the whole audience (D54). Removing someone revokes access to the collection, its rows, its search hits, and its row attachments at once. Audit: `collection.sharing_changed { collectionId, visibility, role, recipientCount }`.

**Query** (D56, T54). `sort` ≤ 3 `{ fieldId, direction: "asc" | "desc" }` (text, url, number, date, checkbox, and select fields; select sorts by option order; empty values last); `filters` ≤ 10 `{ fieldId, op, value? }`, AND-ed; `q` ≤ 200 characters matches any text or url field (case-insensitive substring); `limit` 1–100 (default 50). Field ids are checked against the schema, operators are enumerated, and JSON paths are bound as parameters. With `viewId`, the view's sort and filters apply unless the request gives its own; view clauses that name removed fields are dropped.

| Types | Operators and `value` |
| --- | --- |
| text, url | `contains` / `equals` (non-empty string), `empty`, `not_empty` |
| number, date | `eq`, `lt`, `lte`, `gt`, `gte` (a number, or `YYYY-MM-DD`), `empty` |
| checkbox | `is` (boolean) |
| select | `is`, `is_not` (an option id), `in` (1–20 option ids) |
| multi_select | `has_any`, `has_all` (1–20 option ids) |
| note, file | `empty`, `not_empty` |

`nextCursor` is opaque: an offset bound to the spec and to `schema_version`. A cursor from another spec is 400 `INVALID_CURSOR`; after a schema change it is 409 `SCHEMA_CHANGED`. Offsets stop at 10,000.

**Audit** (ids and counts only, never values or names): `collection.create { collectionId, fieldCount, templateId? }`, `collection.update`, `collection.delete`, `collection.schema_update { collectionId, fieldCount }`, `collection.row_create`, `collection.row_update { collectionId, rowId, fieldCount }`, `collection.row_undo`, `collection.row_delete`.
## Calendar (Wave 12)

Calendars, events, links, reminders, notifications, Web Push, and iCalendar feeds ([WAVES_10-12.md](WAVES_10-12.md) §4, D54, D61–D66). JSON only, except the feed itself.

**Roles (D54).** The owner does everything. Everyone the calendar is shared with (`visibility` `selected` with a member row, or `all_users`) gets the calendar's single audience role `share_role`: `viewer` reads, `editor` also creates, edits, undoes, skips dates on, links, and bins events. Only the owner renames, recolours, shares, or bins the calendar.

| Caller | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Cannot read the calendar (stranger, removed member, binned calendar) | **404** |
| Viewer calling an event write | 403 `{ code: "READ_ONLY" }` |
| Viewer or editor calling an owner-only action | 403 `{ code: "OWNER_ONLY" }` |

```ts
type CalendarColor = "blue" | "green" | "amber" | "red" | "violet" | "slate";
type CalendarSummary = {
  id: string; owner_id: string; owner_name: string; is_owner: 0 | 1;
  role: "owner" | "editor" | "viewer";
  name: string; color: CalendarColor; visibility: Visibility; share_role: "viewer" | "editor";
  created_at: string; updated_at: string;
};
type RepeatRule = {
  freq: "daily" | "weekly" | "monthly" | "yearly";
  interval: number;                 // 1–99, default 1
  byDay?: ("MO"|"TU"|"WE"|"TH"|"FR"|"SA"|"SU")[];  // weekly only; must include the start's weekday
  until?: string;                   // yyyy-mm-dd, inclusive, local to the event
  count?: number;                   // 1–730; not with until
};
type EventDetail = {
  id: string; calendar_id: string; title: string; description: string; location: string;
  all_day: boolean;
  start_date: string | null; end_date: string | null;          // all-day: yyyy-mm-dd, end exclusive
  start_local: string | null; tz: string | null; duration_minutes: number | null;  // timed: yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM, IANA zone, 1–10080
  repeat: RepeatRule | null; exdates: string[];                // skipped local start dates, ≤ 200
  revision: number; canUndo: boolean; changedByKey: boolean; changedByKeyName: string | null;  // MCP key behind the last change
  created_by_name: string | null; updated_by_name: string | null; created_at: string; updated_at: string;
};
type EventLink = { targetType: "note" | "card" | "collection_row"; targetId: string; title: string | null; restricted: boolean };
type EventResponse = { event: EventDetail; calendar: CalendarSummary; role: CalendarSummary["role"]; links: EventLink[] };
type Occurrence = {
  eventId: string; calendarId: string; title: string; location: string; color: CalendarColor;
  allDay: boolean;
  date: string;                     // local start date of the occurrence (what an exdate names)
  start: string; end: string;       // timed: UTC ISO instants; all-day: yyyy-mm-dd, end exclusive
  recurring: boolean;
};
```

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/calendars` | any | 200 `{ calendars: CalendarSummary[] }`, owned first. A user who has never had a calendar gets "Personal" (blue) on this call. | — |

| `DELETE /api/events/:e/links {targetType, targetId}` | editor | 200 `{ ok }` | 403, 404 |

**Event bodies.** Create takes `{ title (1–200), description? (≤ 8 KiB, line breaks kept), location? (≤ 200), allDay, startDate+endDate | startLocal+tz+durationMinutes, repeat? }`. Titles, names, and locations reject control and bidi-override characters. Dates must be real (no 2026-02-30) and zones must be accepted by `Intl` (T71). PATCH takes any subset plus `revision`; timing fields are merged with the stored ones and validated together, and switching `allDay` needs the other mode's fields. Every successful change (PATCH, exdate) keeps the previous values for **one-step undo** (D61); undo itself cannot be undone. A stale `revision` returns 409 `{ code: "EVENT_CHANGED", revision, event }` with the current event.

**Range listing.** `from` and `to` are whole local days (`yyyy-mm-dd`, `to` exclusive) in the viewer's zone `tz` (default `UTC`), at most **100 days** apart (400 otherwise). Occurrences are expanded server-side: timed occurrences keep their wall time in the event's zone across DST (a gap shifts forward, an overlap takes the earlier instant); monthly repeats use the start's day of the month and skip months without it. An occurrence that started before `from` but overlaps the range is included. At most **1000** occurrences are returned per request; `truncated` is true when more existed (T66). `calendars` is an optional comma-separated list of up to 50 calendar ids; ids the caller cannot read are ignored.

**Tasks due (D67).** `include=tasks` (the only accepted value; anything else is 400) adds `tasks: [{ cardId, boardId, boardName, title, parentTitle, dueOn, dueTime, dueTz, dueAt, date }]` (`parentTitle`, 17A: the live parent on the same board, else null): live cards that fall in `[from, to)` for the viewer, on boards the caller can read (the Task Boards predicate), in columns not marked done, at most 200, ordered by `date` (date-only cards first, then timed ones by instant). A date-only card falls on its `due_on`; a card with a due time (Wave 13, §5.2) falls on the viewer-local day of its exact instant `dueAt` in `tz`, which `date` carries, so a card due 23:30 in UTC+14 shows a day earlier to a UTC−12 viewer. The query widens `[from, to)` by two days on each side (zones span 26 hours), but narrows in SQL before any limit: date-only cards must have `due_on` in `[from, to)`, and timed cards a wall time within 14 hours of the viewer's range; the exact instant check follows, so busy days just outside the range never push in-range cards out (at most 5000 rows are read before that check). The overlay is read-only and filters boards with `readableBoardPredicate` from `server/tasks/access.ts`. `cards.due_on` and `board_columns.is_done` come from migration 011, which always runs before 013. Without `include`, the key is absent.

**Links.** The linker must be able to read the target, and an unreadable target returns the same 404 as a missing one. Links are resolved per viewer on every read: the title when the viewer can read the target, otherwise `{ title: null, restricted: true }` (T59). Links never grant access. `note` targets use the live note ACL, `card` targets the Tasks board ACL (`readableCard`; the card's title), and `collection_row` targets the Collections ACL (`readableRow`; the row's primary field), each registered in `server/calendar/links.ts`.

**Audit.** `calendar.create`, `calendar.update`, `calendar.delete`, `calendar.sharing_changed { calendarId, visibility, shareRole, recipientCount }`, `event.create { eventId, calendarId }`, `event.update`, `event.undo`, `event.exdate`, `event.delete { eventId }`, `event.link` / `event.unlink { eventId, targetType, targetId }`. Ids only: titles, descriptions, and locations are never audited.

### Reminders and notifications (Wave 12 stage B)

Reminders are private to whoever set them (D64): every endpoint is scoped to the caller, and anyone who can read an event (viewers included) may set their own reminders on it.

```ts
type Reminder = { id: string; eventId: string | null; offsetMinutes: number | null; title: string | null; tz: string; nextFireAt: string | null; lastFiredAt: string | null; createdAt: string };
type NotificationItem = { id: string; title: string; href: string; late: boolean; read: boolean; createdAt: string; occurrenceStart: string | null };
```

| Endpoint | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/reminders?eventId` | 200 `{ reminders: Reminder[] }`: the caller's event reminders and upcoming standalone ones | 400 (malformed `eventId`) |
| `POST /api/reminders {eventId, offsetMinutes, tz}` | 201 `{ reminder }` | 400; 404 (event not readable); 409 `REMINDER_EXISTS` (same offset) or `LIMIT_REACHED` (10 per event per user) |
| `POST /api/reminders {title, fireAt, tz}` | 201 `{ reminder }` | 400 (`fireAt` is a real local `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM` in `tz`, in the future); 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (500 upcoming standalone per user) |
| `DELETE /api/reminders/:id` | 200 `{ ok }` | 404 (missing or someone else's) |
| `GET /api/notifications?unread=1&limit` | 200 `{ items: NotificationItem[], unreadCount }`, newest first, `limit` 1–50 (default 20) | 400 |
| `POST /api/notifications/read {ids: uuid[1..100]} \| {all: true}` | 200 `{ ok, updated }`; ids that are not the caller's are ignored | 400 |

- `offsetMinutes` is how long before each occurrence starts the reminder fires (−1440 to 40320; negative is after the start). Timed events use their own zone; all-day events start at midnight in the reminder's `tz`, so 09:00 on the day is −540. A single event in the past has no upcoming time (400).
- **Dispatcher.** Every 30 s (an `unref` timer, one tick at a time, at most 200 reminders per tick) each due reminder is claimed, re-checked, written as a durable `notifications` row, and advanced to its next occurrence in one transaction. A reminder missed while the server was down fires once, `late: true`, when under 24 h late, and is skipped when later; either way it advances past now, so misses never pile up. At most 60 notifications per user per hour are written; the rest are dropped.
- **Access (T67).** At fire time the dispatcher re-checks that the user is still in the calendar's audience and deletes the reminder otherwise (audited `reminder.removed_access_lost`). A binned event or calendar pauses its reminders (`nextFireAt: null`); restoring it, editing the event's timing, undo, or skipping a date reschedules them.
- **Titles and links.** Titles are resolved when listed: the event's current title while the caller can read it, otherwise "An event you can no longer open"; a standalone reminder's own title. `href` is `/calendar/event/<id>` built from a validated event id, or `/notifications` (T68).
- **Deep links (v0.32).** Every `href` is a same-origin path built from ids only by the mail link builders (`server/mail/links.ts` `paths`, which refuse anything but a lowercase UUID), never from a title. Where each kind opens:

  | Notification | `href` |
  | --- | --- |
  | Reminder on an event | `/calendar/event/<event>` while readable, else `/notifications`; a standalone reminder: `/notifications` |
  | Proposals (a key's burst or a routine run) | about exactly one proposal: `/inbox/p/<id>` (pending) or `/inbox/history/p/<id>` (resolved); several: `/inbox` |
  | `share_removed`, `share_lowered` (to the item's owner) | the item while the owner can open it: `/notes/<id>`, `/notes/folder/<id>`, `/files/<id>`, `/tasks/<board>`, `/tasks/views/<id>`, `/collections/<id>`, `/calendar` (calendars have no page), `/settings/agents/<id>`, `/chat/<id>`, `/settings/knowledge/<id>`; otherwise that module's list (`/notes`, `/files`, `/tasks`, `/collections`, `/settings/agents`, `/chat`, `/settings/knowledge`) |
  | `access_reset` (to an owner, about several items) | `/notifications` |
  | `access_reset_self`, `group_added`, `group_removed`, `feed_revoked` | `/settings/access` |
  | `key_revoked`, `key_vault_limited`, `key_vault_volume` | `/settings/keys` |
  | `routine_paused` | `/inbox/routines` |
  | `new_sign_in`, `google_*` | `/settings/security` |
  | `vault_shared`, `vault_removed`, `vault_key_rotated` | `/vault/<id>` while readable, else `/vault` |
  | `agent_shared` / `chat_shared` | `/chat/new?agent=<id>` / `/chat/<id>` while readable, else `/chat` |
  | `agent_changed`, `knowledge_base_shared` | `/settings/agents/<id>`, `/settings/knowledge/<id>` while readable, else the section |

  The client (`safeNotificationPath`) follows an `href` only when the router parses it and formats it back to the same path (ids lowercased) and it is not Home; `public/sw.js` keeps an explicit list of these shapes. Anything else opens `/notifications`. Opening an item the reader has since lost shows that module's own "not found" state. Clicking marks the notification read first; on a phone the bell is the `/notifications` page, so Back returns there. Mail kinds that link an item already use the same builders (`tasks.assigned`, `tasks.comment`, `sharing.shared`, `calendar.reminder`, `inbox.proposals`, `security.new_sign_in`); access notices have no mail kind (O-A13).
- **Retention.** The hourly sweeper deletes notifications after 30 days, and fired standalone reminders 30 days after they fired.
- **Audit.** `reminder.create { reminderId, eventId? }`, `reminder.delete { reminderId }`: ids only.
- **Today.** `listUpcoming(userId, tz, days)` in `server/calendar/service.ts` backs the `upcoming` section (registered in `server/today/providers.ts`, between `binSoon` and `storage`): unfinished occurrences through the next 7 local days, at most 10 with `more`, as `{ eventId, calendarId, title, start, end, allDay, date }`. `get_today` includes it, and calendar and event items in `binSoon`, only for keys that also hold `calendar:read` (T74).

### Web Push (Wave 12 stage C)

Payload-less Web Push (D65, T62, T63). A push has an empty body: it only wakes the device, and the service worker fetches `GET /api/notifications?unread=1` with the session cookie, so push services see timing only.

| Endpoint | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/push/config` | 200 `{ enabled: true, publicKey }` (base64url P-256 point) or `{ enabled: false, reason: "insecure_origin" \| "disabled" }` | — |
| `GET /api/push/subscriptions` | 200 `{ subscriptions: [{ id, label, createdAt, lastSuccessAt, disabled }] }` (endpoints are never returned) | — |
| `POST /api/push/subscriptions {endpoint, expirationTime?, keys: {p256dh, auth}, label?}` | 201 `{ subscription }`; 200 when the caller already has this endpoint (keys refreshed, failures cleared) | 400 `ENDPOINT_NOT_ALLOWED`; 409 `PUSH_DISABLED` or `LIMIT_REACHED` (10 per user) |
| `DELETE /api/push/subscriptions {id} \| {endpoint}` | 200 `{ ok }` | 404 (missing or someone else's) |
| `POST /api/push/test` | 200 `{ ok, sent, failed }` | 409 `PUSH_DISABLED`; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` (5 per hour per user) |

- **Enabled.** `PUSH_ENABLED=auto` turns push on only when `APP_ORIGIN` is `https:`; `true` forces it on and `false` off. When on, a VAPID ES256 key pair is created at first boot in `DATA_DIR/push/vapid.json` (0600, written atomically).
- **Endpoints.** `https:` on port 443, no credentials, not an IP literal, and a host on the allowlist (`*.googleapis.com`, `*.push.services.mozilla.com`, `*.push.apple.com`, `*.notify.windows.com`, plus `PUSH_ENDPOINT_HOSTS`). Every address the host resolves to must be public (no private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, or multicast ranges); this is checked when subscribing and again before each delivery. An endpoint is owned by one account: subscribing it from another account moves it.
- **Delivery.** After each dispatcher tick commits, every user who got a notification gets one push per device: `POST` with no body, `TTL: 3600`, `Urgency: normal`, and `Authorization: vapid t=<JWT>, k=<publicKey>` (claims `aud` = the endpoint's origin, `exp` = 12 h, `sub` = `PUSH_SUBJECT`). Redirects are not followed and requests time out after 5 s. 404 or 410 deletes the subscription; any other failure (including a redirect) counts, and 5 consecutive failures disable it until the device subscribes again.
- **Audit.** `push.subscribe { subscriptionId }`, `push.unsubscribe`. Endpoints and keys are never logged or audited.

<a id="calendar-feeds"></a>
### iCalendar feeds (Wave 12 stage D)

Read-only subscription links for phone and desktop calendars (D66, T64, T65, T70). A reader of a calendar (owner, editor, or viewer) creates up to **5** live links per calendar, each `busy` (times only, every event titled "Busy", and the calendar named "Busy") or `full` (titles, locations, and descriptions). The token is returned once and stored only as its SHA-256 hash plus a 13-character display prefix (`nookfeed_` and four characters).

```ts
type CalendarFeed = { id: string; calendarId: string; prefix: string; detail: "busy" | "full"; createdAt: string; lastUsedAt: string | null };
```

| Endpoint | Who | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/calendars/:k/feeds` | reader | 200 `{ feeds: CalendarFeed[] }`: the caller's own live links for this calendar, newest first | 404 |
| `POST /api/calendars/:k/feeds {detail}` | reader | 201 `{ feed, token, url }`; `url` is `<origin>/api/calendars/:k/feed.ics?token=<token>` on the request's origin when it is one of `APP_ORIGINS`, else `APP_ORIGIN` | 400; 404; 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (5 live links per user per calendar) |
| `DELETE /api/feeds/:f` | the link's creator | 200 `{ ok }`; the link stops working at once | 404 (unknown, revoked, or someone else's) |
| `GET /api/calendars/:k/feed.ics?token=` | the token | 200 `text/calendar; charset=utf-8` | 404 for every failure; 429 with `Retry-After` above 60 fetches per hour per live token, and for failures past 30 per minute from one client address (live tokens from that address still work). Unknown tokens never get a per-token entry; both limiters are capped and evict the least recently used entry |

- **Authentication.** The feed route is the only `/api` path outside the session and TOTP middleware. `isFeedRequest` in `server/calendar/feeds.ts` exempts exactly `GET` or `HEAD` of `/api/calendars/<uuid>/feed.ics`; every other method, and any other path, still needs a session. Tokens are created from a signed-in (and, under `TOTP_POLICY=required`, gated) session.
- **Live access.** Every fetch re-checks that the token's creator is enabled, still allowed by `ALLOWED_EMAILS`, and can still read the calendar. A malformed, unknown, or revoked token, a token for another calendar, a binned calendar, and a creator who lost access all return the same `404 {"error":"Not found"}`.
- **Output (RFC 5545).** `VERSION:2.0`, `PRODID:-//Nook//Calendar feed//EN`, `METHOD:PUBLISH`, `X-WR-CALNAME`; one `VEVENT` per live event with `UID:<event id>@nook`, `DTSTAMP`, timed `DTSTART;TZID=<zone>:<local>` plus `DURATION:PT<n>M` or all-day `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE`/`DTEND;VALUE=DATE`, `RRULE` (`FREQ`, `INTERVAL`, `WKST=MO` and `BYDAY` for weekly, `COUNT`, or `UNTIL` as a date for all-day events and as the last second of the until day in UTC for timed ones), and `EXDATE` in the same form as the start. No `VTIMEZONE` blocks. `SUMMARY`, `LOCATION`, and `DESCRIPTION` are escaped (`\\`, `\;`, `\,`, and every CR, LF, CRLF, U+2028, or U+2029 as `\n`; other control characters dropped); lines are folded at 75 octets without splitting a UTF-8 sequence, with CRLF endings. At most 5000 events, most recent series first.
- **Headers.** `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and the global CSP unchanged. No cookie is set.
- **Bookkeeping.** `last_used_at` is written at most every 10 minutes. The token is never logged or audited; `calendar.feed_created` and `calendar.feed_revoked` record `{ feedId, calendarId }` only. Purging a calendar deletes its links.

<a id="calendar-items-in-the-bin"></a>
### Calendar items in the Bin (D68)

`DELETE /api/calendars/:k` and `DELETE /api/events/:e` move items to the shared Bin through Bin providers registered by `server/calendar/calendarBin.ts` (like Collections), with the same columns (`board_*` and `attachment*` null/false), 30-day retention, tombstone, and compare-and-swap restore as notes and documents (no bytes to remove).

| Item | Listed for | Restore | Delete forever |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calendar` (`folder_id`/`folder_name` null) | its owner | owner | owner; cascades to its events, members, links, reminders, and feeds |
| `event` (`folder_id`/`folder_name` = its calendar) | the calendar's owner, and whoever deleted it while they can still edit the calendar (`can_purge: false` for them) | the same two | the calendar's owner only (404 for anyone else) |

- A binned calendar hides all of its events; they are not listed one by one and come back with it.
- Restore responses for these types are `{ ok: true, calendarId, calendarName }` (plus `alreadyRestored: true` for a live item). Restoring an event whose calendar is in the Bin returns 409 `{ code: "PARENT_IN_BIN" }`; restoring a calendar when the owner already has 20 live ones returns 409 `{ code: "LIMIT_REACHED" }`. A purge in progress returns 409 `PURGING`, as for other types.
- `GET /api/bin?type=calendar|event` filters; the Bin app's Calendar chip shows both.
- Empty Bin purges the caller's binned calendars and the binned events on calendars they own; events they deleted on someone else's calendar stay for that owner.
- The hourly sweeper resumes tombstones and purges expired calendars and events with the same per-table budgets (events first).
- Audit: `calendar.restore { calendarId }`, `event.restore { eventId, calendarId }`, `calendar.purge { calendarId, reason }`, `event.purge { eventId, reason }` with `reason` `user`, `retention`, or `resumed`.

## Team (Wave 14)

Plan of record: [research/2026-09-26-team-module.md](research/2026-09-26-team-module.md) (§11 overrides the earlier text). Migration `017_team_roles`.

**Roles.** `users.role` is `admin | member | viewer | guest` (D71). All four are assignable since Wave 15 (see *Viewer and guest enforcement* below). The first account registered on an empty database is `admin` (D76, inside the register transaction), and so is one registered while no active admin exists (`role = 'admin' AND disabled_at IS NULL`), with a `team_events` row `via = 'bootstrap'`; every later registration gets `SIGNUP_ROLE` (`guest` by default, or `viewer` or `member`; never `admin`, D80), or the role of the invite it used (see *Invites* below); the server also logs a warning at boot in that state. On upgrade every account becomes `member` and the oldest enabled one `admin` (O8). `role` is returned on `user` by `POST /api/auth/register`, `POST /api/auth/login`, and `GET /api/auth/me`; no request body accepts it except the Team role route.

**Always one active admin.** "Active admin" means `role = 'admin' AND disabled_at IS NULL`. Every write that would leave none returns 409 `LAST_ADMIN`; the `users_keep_one_admin` triggers refuse it in SQL too (T78).

**Block.** Blocking reuses `users.disabled_at` (D74), shown as `blockedAt`. Sign-in for a blocked account returns 403 `{ code: "ACCOUNT_BLOCKED", error: "This account has been blocked. Contact your Nook administrator." }` only after the right password and before any second factor is checked; a wrong password still gets the generic 401. The block reason is never shown to the blocked user (O11).

### Types

```ts
type TeamRole = "admin" | "member" | "viewer" | "guest";
type TeamMember = {
  id: string; displayName: string; role: TeamRole; status: "active" | "blocked"; createdAt: string; isYou: boolean;
  // Admins only (T85): absent for everyone else.
  email?: string; lastSeenAt?: string | null; blockedAt?: string | null;
  blockedBy?: { id: string; displayName: string } | null; blockReason?: string | null;
  totpEnabled?: boolean; mcpKeys?: { live: number }; storageBytes?: number; emailAllowed?: boolean;

type TeamEvent = {

};
```

`lastSeenAt` is the latest `last_seen_at` of the account's live sessions (null once they are gone). `blockedBy` is null for accounts disabled before migration 017 ("Blocked (before Team)"). `emailAllowed` is false when the address is no longer on `ALLOWED_EMAILS`, so the account cannot sign in. `storageBytes` is the quota sum (live and binned documents).

### Endpoints

Guests get **404** on every Team route. Members and viewers read; every write needs `admin` (403 `ADMIN_ONLY` otherwise). Writes count against 30 a minute per admin (429 `RATE_LIMITED`). A malformed or unknown `:userId` is 404. Bodies are strict JSON (extra fields are 400).

| Endpoint | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/team` | | 200 `{ me: { id, role }, users: TeamMember[] }`, active before blocked, then admin, member, viewer, guest, then name; at most 500 | 404 (guest) |
| `GET /api/team/:userId` | | 200 `{ member: TeamMember & { events?: TeamEvent[] } }`; `events` (latest 50) for admins only | 404 |
| `PUT /api/team/:userId/role` | `{ role, expectedRole }` (strict: any other field → 400) | 200 `{ changed, role, member }`; `changed: false` when `role` equals the current role (no event) | 409 `ROLE_CHANGED` `{ currentRole }` (compare-and-swap on `expectedRole`, T79), `LAST_ADMIN`; 400 `GUEST_SHARE_DISABLED` (to `guest` while `share_with_guests` is off and the person is in a group with a grant, Wave 32 T213) |
| `POST /api/team/:userId/block` | `{ reason?: string ≤ 200 }` (strict: any other field → 400) | 200 `{ blockedAt, sessionsRevoked, mcpKeysPaused, member }` | 409 `SELF_ACTION`, `ALREADY_BLOCKED`, `LAST_ADMIN`, `ROLE_CHANGED` |
| `POST /api/team/:userId/unblock` | `{}` | 200 `{ ok: true, member }` | 409 `NOT_BLOCKED` |
| `POST /api/team/:userId/sessions/revoke` | `{}` | 200 `{ sessionsRevoked, member }` | 409 `SELF_ACTION` (use Sign out) |

- **No re-authentication.** Team writes rely on the signed-in session, CSRF (Origin + `X-CSRF-Token`, JSON only), SameSite=Strict cookies, and the admin capability. The password + second-factor re-check was removed by operator decision on 2026-09-27 (it created friction). The residual risk is recorded in THREAT_MODEL T77/T82.
- **Role change** runs `UPDATE users SET role = ? WHERE id = ? AND role = ?`. It takes effect on the target's next request (the role is read on every request, no cache). An admin may demote themselves while another active admin exists.
- **Block** runs one transaction: set `disabled_at`, `blocked_by`, `block_reason`; delete every session of the account (an unblock does not revive them); delete its push subscriptions. MCP keys and calendar feed tokens are kept and pause (their existing `disabled_at` checks), then resume on unblock (O9). Content the account owns stays where it is and stays shared (O10). The account drops out of share pickers and assignee lists. An upload that passed `requireAuth` before the block fails at commit with 401 and its staged object is removed; the reminders dispatcher skips blocked accounts (their reminders stay due and fire after an unblock). Upload slots are per request in memory and are released as those requests fail; there are no persistent upload reservations.
- **Unblock** clears the three columns. The account signs in again with its existing password and second factor; push must be re-enabled per device; the role is unchanged.
- **Audit and activity** (T83): each write adds one `team_events` row (append-only through triggers) and one `audit_log` row with ids and roles only: `team.role_changed { targetId, fromRole, toRole, via }`, `team.user_blocked { targetId, sessions, via }`, `team.user_unblocked { targetId, via }`, `team.sessions_revoked { targetId, sessions, via }`, `team.bootstrap_admin { targetId }`, and . The block reason lives only in `users.block_reason` and the `block` event. Blocked sign-in attempts are audited as `auth.login_blocked`.

### Invites (Wave 18)

Plan of record: [WAVES_18-20_SMALL.md](WAVES_18-20_SMALL.md) §1 and its Director review. Migration `018_team_invites`. Decisions D161–D169.

An admin creates a **single-use link with a fixed team role** (`member`, `viewer`, or `guest`; never `admin`, which the migration's CHECK also refuses). The link is `<origin>/register#invite=<token>`: the token sits in the URL **fragment**, which browsers never send to the server, so it stays out of access logs, proxies, and `Referer`. The SPA reads it once, strips it from the address bar with `history.replaceState`, and posts it in JSON bodies only. The token is 32 random bytes in base64url (43 characters); only its SHA-256 and a 6-character prefix are stored, and it is returned once, by the create call.

```ts
type TeamInvite = {
  id: string; tokenPrefix: string; role: "member" | "viewer" | "guest";
  email: string | null;          // bound address: only it can register with the link
  note: string | null;           // admin-only label, at most 80 characters
  status: "live" | "used" | "expired" | "revoked";
  createdAt: string; expiresAt: string;
  createdBy: { id: string; displayName: string } | null;
  usedBy: { id: string; displayName: string } | null;
  usedAt: string | null; revokedAt: string | null;
};
type MailOutcome = { sent: true; id: string } | { sent: false; reason: "not_configured" | "rate_limited" | "failed" };
```

An invite is **usable** only while it is unused, unrevoked, unexpired, and its creator is still an **active admin** (`role = 'admin' AND disabled_at IS NULL`, checked at use time): a demoted or blocked admin's links stop working, and work again if the privilege is restored.

| Endpoint | Who | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/team/invites` | admin | | 200 `{ invites: TeamInvite[], liveCount, liveLimit: 20, emailEnabled }`: every live invite plus the latest 100 others, newest first | 404 (guest), 403 `ADMIN_ONLY` |
| `POST /api/team/invites` | admin | `{ role, email?, expiresInDays?: 1..7 (default 7), note?, sendEmail?, templateId? }` (strict; `templateId` since Wave 33, see "Central access management") | 201 `{ invite, token, url, email?: MailOutcome }`; `email` only with `sendEmail` | 400 `EMAIL_NOT_ALLOWED` (bound email not on `ALLOWED_EMAILS`), 400 `EMAIL_REQUIRED` (`sendEmail` without `email`), 409 `ACCOUNT_EXISTS`, 409 `INVITE_LIMIT` (20 live on the instance), 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (10 creations an hour per admin) |
| `POST /api/team/invites/:inviteId/revoke` | admin | `{}` | 200 `{ invite }`; repeating on a revoked invite answers the same | 404, 409 `INVITE_NOT_LIVE` (used or expired) |
| `POST /api/team/invites/:inviteId/email` | admin | `{}` | 200 `{ invite, email: MailOutcome }`. A fresh token is mailed to the bound address; once the mail is accepted it replaces the old one, so the earlier link stops working. The new token is never returned. | 400 `EMAIL_REQUIRED` (no bound email), 404, 409 `INVITE_NOT_LIVE` |
| `POST /api/auth/invite` | anyone (pre-auth: Origin and JSON checks, no session) | `{ token }` | 200 `{ role, emailHint, expiresAt, inviterName }`; `emailHint` is masked (`p•••@example.com`) or null | 400 (malformed), 404 `INVITE_INVALID` (unknown, used, revoked, or creator no longer an active admin), 410 `INVITE_EXPIRED`, 429 (10 a minute per client address, then 60 a minute instance-wide; Wave 35 S7) |

The invite writes also count against the 30 Team writes a minute per admin. `/api/team/invites` is matched before `/api/team/:userId`.

**Register with an invite.** `POST /api/auth/register` accepts an optional `inviteToken` (the body stays strict, so `role` is still refused with 400). With a token:

- the body is read before the `ALLOW_REGISTRATION` check, and a usable invite **bypasses only** `ALLOW_REGISTRATION`; `ALLOWED_EMAILS` still applies (403);
- the invite is checked before the "account exists" lookup, so a made-up token cannot probe which emails are registered;
- a bound email must match case-insensitively (403 `INVITE_EMAIL_MISMATCH`);
- 404 `INVITE_INVALID` or 410 `INVITE_EXPIRED` otherwise. An invalid token is **never silently ignored**, even while registration is open;
- the account gets the invite's role, and the invite is claimed inside the user-insert transaction by one guarded `UPDATE … WHERE used_at IS NULL AND revoked_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now`; a lost race rolls the new account back and answers `INVITE_INVALID` (T141);
- an **empty instance ignores the token**: its first account is the admin (D76, D163). On an instance whose accounts exist but have no active admin, no invite is usable (its creator is not an active admin), so the call fails instead of creating an admin.

**Audit.** `team.invite_create`, `team.invite_revoke`, `team.invite_accept` (actor: the new account), and `team.invite_emailed`, each with `{ inviteId, role }` only: never the token, its hash, or an email. `team_events` is unchanged; the admin member detail gets `joinedWithInvite: { role, usedAt, invitedBy } | null`, derived from `team_invites.used_by`, shown in Activity as "Joined with an invite from <admin>, as <role>".

**Sweeper.** Invites dead (used, revoked, or expired) for 90 days are deleted hourly. Live invites are never swept.

**Email.** `sendEmail` and the email route go through `server/mail.ts` (Resend, see OPERATIONS.md "Email (Resend)"). Mail goes only to the invite's bound address. When email is off (`RESEND_API_KEY` or `MAIL_FROM` unset) the invite is still created and the outcome is `{ sent: false, reason: "not_configured" }`; the UI shows "Email is not configured". The message is plain text plus minimal inline-styled HTML with the link, the role, the expiry (UTC), and the inviter's display name; no images, remote content, or tracking.

### Host CLI

`bun server/team-admin.ts list | set-role <email> admin|member|viewer|guest | unblock <email>` (in Docker: `docker compose exec mynotes bun server/team-admin.ts …`). `list` shows integrations after people, marked "(integration)"; every other command refuses an integration's address ("That account is an integration; manage it in Team → Integrations.", exit 1). It runs the same service functions with no actor and `via = 'cli'`, so the last-admin rule applies; exit codes are 0 (done), 1 (refused or unknown account, with the error code), and 2 (usage).

### MCP (`team:read`)

`team:read` is admin-only: `POST /api/mcp/keys` refuses it for other roles with 403 `SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED`, and a key's **effective scopes** are its stored scopes narrowed to what the holder's current role allows, computed on every `/mcp` request and every tool call (`effectiveMcpScopes`, T81). A demoted admin's key loses the Team tools on its next call (hidden from `tools/list`, `SCOPE_REQUIRED` from a direct call) and gets them back if the role is restored. No write tools exist (D79). Output never includes emails or block reasons (O12).

| Tool | Scope | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_team_members` | team:read | `{ role?, status?: "active" \| "blocked" }` | `{ members: [{ id, displayName, role, status, createdAt, lastSeenAt }] }` |
| `get_team_member` | team:read | `{ userId }` | the same fields plus `blockedAt` and `events` (latest 20: `{ action, fromRole, toRole, createdAt, actor }` with the actor's display name) |
| `list_invites` | team:read | `{ status?: "live" \| "all" }` (default all) | `{ liveCount, liveLimit, invites: [{ id, role, status, createdAt, expiresAt, createdBy, usedBy }] }` with display names; never a token, prefix, email, or label. There is no create, revoke, or email tool (D168). |

## Viewer and guest enforcement (Wave 15)

Plan of record: [research/2026-09-26-team-module.md](research/2026-09-26-team-module.md) §2.2, §5.2–§5.4, §8, and the 17C note in [research/2026-09-26-task-hierarchy-workflows.md](research/2026-09-26-task-hierarchy-workflows.md) (Q12). No migration.

**Audience.** `all_users` ("Everyone here") means every account except guests. Every SQL comparison `x.visibility = 'all_users'` is ANDed with `AUDIENCE_ALL_USERS` (`server/team/roles.ts`): notes, folders, files, search, boards and their cards, card relations, the task query, task views, board readers and assignees, collections, calendars and events, Today, feeds, and MCP. A guest therefore reads only their own items and items shared with them by name (`selected`); a viewer reads `all_users` too. A role change applies on the next request (T84).

**Write gate.** For viewers and guests every `/api` request other than GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS is refused with 403 `{ error: "Your team role is read-only", code: "ROLE_READ_ONLY" }` unless it is on this exact allowlist (`ROLE_READ_ONLY_ALLOWED_WRITES` in `server/team/writeGate.ts`; `:param` is one path segment):

| Method and path | Who | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | both | sign out |
| `POST /api/auth/totp/setup`, `POST /api/auth/totp/enable`, `POST /api/auth/totp/recovery-codes`, `POST /api/auth/totp/recovery-codes/regenerate`, `DELETE /api/auth/totp` | both | own two-factor |
| `POST /api/auth/password/change` | both | own password (Wave 30) |
| `DELETE /api/auth/devices/:id`, `DELETE /api/auth/devices` | both | forget own recognised devices (migration 044) |
| `POST /api/notifications/read` | both | own notifications |
| `POST /api/push/subscriptions`, `DELETE /api/push/subscriptions`, `POST /api/push/test` | both | own push devices |
| `POST /api/reminders`, `DELETE /api/reminders/:reminderId` | both | own reminders on readable events (O4) |
| `PUT /api/preferences` | both | own Modules preference |
| `POST /api/mcp/keys`, `DELETE /api/mcp/keys/:id` | both | own keys; creation is then limited by role (below) |
| `POST /api/collections/:collectionId/query` | both | a read sent as POST |
| `POST /api/tasks/query` | both | a read sent as POST; a **guest's** `q` must contain a plain `assignee:me` term (not negated, the only value), otherwise 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` |
| `POST /api/inbox/proposals/:id/reject`, `POST /api/inbox/proposals/bulk`, `PUT /api/inbox/settings` | viewer | clear own proposals and the own proposal push setting (Wave 21, D152); bulk `approve` is refused by the handler with 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` |
| `POST /api/tasks/views`, `PATCH /api/tasks/views/:viewId`, `DELETE /api/tasks/views/:viewId`, `POST /api/tasks/views/:viewId/duplicate` | viewer | own private views; `PUT /api/tasks/views/:viewId/sharing` stays refused |

`/api/team/*` answers for itself (guests 404, others 403 `ADMIN_ONLY` on writes). Login and register have no session and are unaffected. Everything else, including every route added later, is refused: note drafts, publish, version restore, sharing, folders, uploads and file changes, Bin restore, purge, and empty (O3), cards, comments, boards, columns, tags, collections, rows, imports, schema, calendars, events, links, and feed tokens (O5). `GET /api/tasks/views/:viewId/cards` is a read. `tests/writeGate.test.ts` enumerates every mutating route in `server/` and checks each one for both roles (T87).

**Share roles** (§2.4): a viewer or guest on a collection or calendar shared with `share_role = "editor"` gets `role: "viewer"` in every response and is refused writes with `READ_ONLY` by the services, which also refuse a read-only role on items it owns. Read-only roles are not given a Personal calendar on first list.

**Share picker.** `GET /api/users` is 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` for viewers and guests (they cannot share). For others each entry gains `role`, so pickers can show "Guest" or "Viewer" next to recipients who will only read.

**MCP.** `mcpScopesForRole`: admin every scope; member every scope but `team:read`; viewer the read scopes only (`notes:read`, `files:read`, `tasks:read`, `today:read`, `calendar:read`, `collections:read`); guest none. Effective scopes are recomputed on every request and tool call (T81), so a demoted member's write key loses its write tools at once and a guest's key has no tools at all. `POST /api/mcp/keys` refuses guests with 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` and a viewer asking for a write scope with 403 `SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED`. Write tools also re-check the holder's role before running (`READ_ONLY`).

**Sign-up role.** `SIGNUP_ROLE` (env, validated at startup: `guest | viewer | member`, default `guest`) is the role of accounts registered after the first (D80, O14).

## Inbox (Wave 21)

Plan of record: [research/2026-09-28-agent-inbox-routines.md](research/2026-09-28-agent-inbox-routines.md) (Wave A; D146–D160 and the director review). Migration `021_agent_inbox` creates `proposals`, `routines`, and `routine_runs` (the last two used from Wave 22, below), adds `notifications.kind | run_id | proposal_key_id | proposal_count`, adds `user_preferences.proposal_push`, and backfills every live MCP-written note draft as a pending `note_draft` proposal.

A **proposal** is a change an MCP key suggests. Only the key's owner sees and reviews it (D147); anyone else gets 404, admins included. It applies only through `approve` below, under a signed-in session that passed CSRF and the TOTP gate; there is no MCP approve tool and no auto-apply (D146).

**Kinds** (D150) mirror the MCP write tools one to one; the payload is that tool's arguments:

| Kind | Payload | Module scope the key also needs | Applied by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `card_create` | `create_card` arguments | `tasks:read` | `create_card` as the approver |
| `card_update` | `update_card` arguments (with `baseRevision`) | `tasks:read` | `update_card` as the approver (`CARD_CHANGED` fails) |
| `card_comment` | `comment_on_card` arguments (body ≤ 8 KiB) | `tasks:read` | `comment_on_card` as the approver |
| `event_create` | `create_event` arguments | `calendar:read` | `create_event` as the approver |
| `event_update` | `update_event` arguments (with `baseRevision`) | `calendar:read` | `update_event` as the approver (`EVENT_CHANGED` fails) |
| `row_create` | `create_row` arguments | `collections:read` | `create_row` as the approver |
| `row_update` | `update_row` arguments (with `baseRevision`) | `collections:read` | `update_row` as the approver (`ROW_CHANGED`, `SCHEMA_CHANGED` fail) |
| `note_draft` | `{ noteId?, folderId?, markdown, mode?: "replace" \| "append", baseRevision? }` | `notes:write-draft` | publish of exactly the recorded draft revision (`DRAFT_CHANGED` fails) |

**Double validation** (D148): at submit the tool's own input schema validates the payload and the target must be readable by the owner (`NOT_FOUND`, the same as missing); at approve the tool's handler runs again through the module's service as the **approver** (ACL, role, CAS, caps). A refusal makes the proposal `failed` with the service's code and nothing is applied. The service's own audit event carries `{ via: "proposal", proposalId, keyId }`; calendar and collection writes set `updated_via_key_id` to the proposal's key, so "Changed by key" still names the agent.

A `note_draft` proposal is a pointer `{ noteId, revision, created }` (D149): submitting writes the draft at once (as `update_note_draft`/`create_note` do), and plain `update_note_draft` and `create_note` record the same proposal. A newer MCP draft on the note supersedes the older proposal. Publishing in the editor resolves it (`applied` `PUBLISHED_IN_EDITOR` when it published that revision, else `superseded` `DRAFT_CHANGED`); discarding rejects it (`DISCARDED_IN_EDITOR`); restoring a version supersedes it (`VERSION_RESTORED`).

**Statuses:** `pending`, `applying` (claimed by an approve in progress), `applied`, `rejected`, `expired`, `failed`, `superseded`, `withdrawn`. Every status but `pending` and `applying` is final.

### Types

```ts
type ProposalSummary = {
  id: string; kind: ProposalKind; kindLabel: string;
  title: string;            // agent text (≤ 120, controls, bidi, and zero-width characters stripped): render as text only
  rationale: string | null; // agent text (≤ 1000, newlines kept): render as text only
  status: ProposalStatus;
  targetLabel: string;      // Nook's own name for the target, resolved for the viewer now, or "restricted"
  restricted: boolean; targetHref: string | null; // ids only; null when restricted
  digest: string; keyName: string;
  createdAt: string; expiresAt: string; resolvedAt: string | null;
  resultCode: string | null; rejectReason: string | null;
  ref: { type: "note" | "card" | "event" | "row"; id: string; href: string } | null; // what an approve produced
  rejectEffect?: "restore" | "discard" | "keep"; // pending note_draft only: what a reject would do to the draft now
};
type ProposalPreview =
  | { restricted: true }
  | { fields: Array<{ name: string; before: string | null; after: string | null }> }
  // base: what the agent's changes are measured against ("Changes by the agent"): the draft recorded just
  // before the agent wrote (baseKind "draft", migration 027), else the published version ("published").
  | { markdown: { published: string; base: string; baseKind: "draft" | "published"; draft: string; draftChanged: boolean } };
```

### Endpoints

Guests get **404** on every Inbox route (and the write gate refuses their writes). Read-only roles may reject (allowlisted above) but not approve.

| Endpoint | Body / query | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/inbox/proposals` | `status=pending\|resolved` (default pending), `group=run\|none`, `cursor`, `limit ≤ 50` | 200 `{ groups: [{ routine: null, run: null, key: { name } \| null, items: ProposalSummary[] }], nextCursor }`. Pending: newest group first, items in submission order. Resolved: newest resolved first | 400 (bad query or cursor) |
| `GET /api/inbox/proposals/:id` | | 200 `{ proposal: ProposalSummary & { preview, position?: { index, of, nextId } } }`; the preview is computed now, for the viewer, never stored | 404 |
| `POST /api/inbox/proposals/:id/approve` | `{}` | 200 `{ id, status: "applied", ref }` | 409 `{ status: "failed", code }` (nothing applied); 409 `NOT_PENDING` `{ status }`; 409 `KEY_REVOKED` `{ status: "superseded" }` (the suggesting key was revoked; revoking a key supersedes its pending proposals with `result_code` KEY_REVOKED, and note drafts stay in their notes); 409 `EXPIRED` `{ status: "expired" }` (past `expiresAt`, marked expired at once, before the hourly sweep); 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY`; 404 |
| `POST /api/inbox/proposals/:id/reject` | `{ reason?: string }` (the user's words, cleaned and cut to 200; the agent can read it) | 200 `{ id, status: "rejected", draft?, draftDiscarded? }`. A `note_draft` acts only while the draft is still the proposed revision and the user may write: `draft: "restored"` writes back the draft from before the agent's write as a new revision (audited `inbox.draft_restored`); `"discarded"` drops the agent's draft of a published note that had none; otherwise `"kept"` (a never-published note is never binned by a reject; a draft edited since is left alone). `draftDiscarded` is `draft === "discarded"` | 409 `NOT_PENDING`; 404 |
| `POST /api/inbox/proposals/bulk` | `{ action: "approve" \| "reject", ids: uuid[1..50] }` or `{ action, runId }`, `reason?` | 200 `{ results: [{ id, status, code?, ref?, error? }] }`, applied **one at a time in submission order**, never all-or-nothing; unknown ids are `not_found` | 400; 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` (approve by a read-only role) |
| `GET /api/inbox/count` | | 200 `{ pending }`, at most 100 (`SELECT 1 … LIMIT 100`, T51) | |
| `GET /api/inbox/settings`, `PUT /api/inbox/settings` | `{ push: boolean }` | 200 `{ push }`: whether new-proposal notifications are also pushed (off by default, O5) | 400 |

Approve claims the row `pending → applying` before the service runs, so a double click or a second tab gets `NOT_PENDING`; an unexpected error releases the claim, and a crash leaves `applying`, which the sweeper fails as `INTERRUPTED` after 10 minutes (T129).

**Sweeper** (hourly, D156): pending proposals past `expires_at` (14 days) become `expired` (their targets are untouched; an expired note draft keeps its draft and badge), and resolved proposals are deleted 90 days after they resolved. Audit rows stay.

**Notifications** (D159): a successful `submit_proposals` adds `N` to the key's unread `proposals` notification from the last 15 minutes, or creates one. `GET /api/notifications` lists it as `{ title: "Key “<key name>” suggested N changes", href: "/inbox" }`, built at read time from the key name and the count only, never agent text (T127, T135). It is pushed (payload-less, as reminders) only when the user turned on `push`.

**Today** (D158): the `proposals` section ("Proposals awaiting you", Today group) lists the owner's pending proposals `{ id, kind, kindLabel, title, keyName, created_at, expires_at }`, ten plus `more` from an eleven-row fetch, `href: "/inbox"`. The `agentDrafts` section is no longer returned. `get_today` includes `proposals` for keys with `inbox:read`, listing only that key's own proposals.

**Audit:** `proposal.submitted { keyId, kind, runId, proposalId }`, `proposal.applied { proposalId, kind, keyId }` (plus the service's event with `via: "proposal"`), `proposal.failed { proposalId, kind, keyId, code }`, `proposal.rejected`, `proposal.withdrawn`, `proposal.expired { count }`, `inbox.push_setting { enabled }`. No titles, payloads, or reasons.

### MCP (`inbox:read`, `inbox:write`)

`inbox:write` implies `inbox:read`. Both are member-only: `mcpScopesForRole` leaves them out for viewers and guests (D152). Neither can approve anything (T125).

| Tool | Scope | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `submit_proposals` | inbox:write (+ each kind's module scope) | `{ proposals: [{ kind, title, rationale?, payload }] }`, 1–20 | `{ results: [{ proposalId, status: "pending", expiresAt } \| { error, code, details? }], submitted }`, validated and saved per item. Codes: `INVALID`, `NOT_FOUND`, `SCOPE_REQUIRED`, `READ_ONLY`, `LIMIT_REACHED` (500 pending), `RATE_LIMITED` (`retryAfterSeconds`), `TOO_LARGE` (payload > 64 KiB), `DRAFT_CHANGED` |
| `list_my_proposals` | inbox:read | `{ status?, limit ≤ 50 }` | `{ proposals: [{ id, kind, title, status, resultCode, rejectReason, createdAt, expiresAt, resolvedAt }] }`, this key's own only (T131) |
| `withdraw_proposal` | inbox:write | `{ proposalId }` | `{ proposalId, status: "withdrawn" }`; `NOT_FOUND` for another key's; `INVALID` once resolved |

**Limits:** every item costs one `proposal_write` (200 a day per key, 400 per user); the call costs one `write`. At most 500 pending proposals per user. Payloads are at most 64 KiB of JSON.

## Inbox routines (Wave 22)

Plan of record: the same research doc, §5, §7.2, §8 (Wave B; D152–D155, D159, D160). No new migration: `routines` and `routine_runs` come from `021_agent_inbox`.

A **routine** is a user's stored prompt for an outside agent. Nook never runs it: a client asks what is due, starts a run, submits proposals into it, and finishes it. Every proposal still waits for the owner (D146). Routines are private to their owner (404 for anyone else, admins included); only members and admins create or change them, and a demotion to viewer or guest pauses them (D152).

### Types

```ts
type Routine = {
  id: string; name: string;            // 1–80, unique per owner case-folded
  instructions: string;                // 1 B–16 KiB, the prompt the client runs
  outputKinds: ProposalKind[];         // non-empty; submit refuses other kinds (KIND_NOT_ALLOWED)
  targets: { boardIds?, calendarIds?, collectionIds?, folderIds?: string[] } | null; // ≤ 20 each; readable (folders: owned) when saved
  scopeHints: string | null;           // ≤ 500, guidance only
  cadence: "manual" | "hourly" | "daily" | "weekdays" | "weekly";
  atTime: string | null;               // HH:MM (hourly uses the minute); null for manual
  weekday: number | null;              // 0 Sunday … 6 Saturday, weekly only
  tz: string; scheduleNote: string | null; scheduleText: string; // "Mondays at 08:00"
  keyId: string | null; keyName: string | null; keyRevoked: boolean; // bound key, or any of the owner's keys
  maxProposals: number;                // per run, 1–100, default 25
  expireDays: number;                  // 1–30, default 14, for this routine's proposals
  enabled: boolean; nextDueAt: string | null; due: boolean;
  lastRunAt: string | null; lastRunStatus: RunStatus | null;
  running: { id, startedAt, leaseExpiresAt } | null;
  revision: number; createdAt: string; updatedAt: string;
};
type RunStatus = "running" | "succeeded" | "failed" | "abandoned";
type RunSummary = {
  id, routineId, routineName, status, startedAt, finishedAt, leaseExpiresAt, durationMs,
  toolCalls: number;   // counted by Nook (D160), never reported by the client
  proposals: number; capped: boolean;
  summary: string | null; error: string | null; // agent text: render as text only
  clientLabel: string | null; keyName: string | null;
};
```

**Schedule** (D153): wall-clock slots in `tz`. A new or rescheduled routine is due from its current period's slot (a daily 08:00 routine created at 10:00 is due at once). A resumed one is too, unless a run (not an abandoned one) already took that slot: then it is due at the first slot after max(that slot, now), so pausing and resuming never makes today's run due again. `finish_run` advances `nextDueAt` to the first slot after both the run's slot and now, so a late run does not drift and missed slots do not pile up. A DST gap moves the slot forward by the gap; a repeated hour uses the earlier instant. `manual` is never due but can still be started.

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/inbox/routines` | | 200 `{ routines: Routine[] }` by name | |
| `POST /api/inbox/routines` | `RoutineInput` (the fields above without server-maintained ones; `atTime`, `weekday`, `targets`, `scopeHints`, `scheduleNote`, `keyId`, `maxProposals`, `expireDays`, `enabled` optional) | 200 `{ routine }` | 400 `INVALID`, `INVALID_SCHEDULE`, `INVALID_TIME_ZONE`, `LIMIT_REACHED` (50 per user); 404 `KEY_NOT_FOUND`, `NOT_FOUND` `{ id }` (an unreadable pin); 409 `NAME_TAKEN`; 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` |
| `GET /api/inbox/routines/:id` | | 200 `{ routine }` | 404 |
| `PATCH /api/inbox/routines/:id` | any `RoutineInput` fields plus `revision` | 200 `{ routine }` (revision + 1) | as POST; 409 `ROUTINE_CHANGED` `{ revision }` |
| `DELETE /api/inbox/routines/:id` | | 200 `{ deleted: true }`: a hard delete; runs cascade; its proposals stay, grouped under their key | 404 |
| `POST /api/inbox/routines/:id/pause`, `…/resume` | `{}` | 200 `{ routine }` | 404; 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` |
| `GET /api/inbox/routines/:id/runs` | | 200 `{ runs: RunSummary[] }`, the last 50, newest first | 404 |
| `GET /api/inbox/runs/:id` | | 200 `{ run: RunSummary, proposals: ProposalSummary[] }` | 404 |

`GET /api/inbox/proposals?group=run` now fills `routine: { id, name }` and `run: { id, startedAt, summary, status, capped }` for proposals made in a run, one group per run. `POST /api/inbox/proposals/bulk` with `runId` approves or rejects that run's pending proposals.

**Notifications** (D159): proposals submitted in a run do not notify at submit. `finish_run` (or the sweep abandoning a run) adds one `proposals` notification with the run's count, listed as `"<routine name> suggested N changes"`; the title uses the user's routine name and the count only.

**Sweeper** (hourly, and lazily per owner before routine reads and run starts): a `running` run past `lease_expires_at` becomes `abandoned` (`finished_at` = the lease end); the routine keeps its `next_due_at`, so it stays due, and the run's proposals stay pending. Finished runs are deleted after 180 days.

**Audit:** `routine.created { routineId, cadence, kinds, keyBound }`, `routine.updated | paused | resumed { routineId, scheduleChanged }`, `routine.deleted`, `routine.run_started { routineId, runId, keyId }`, `routine.run_finished { routineId, runId, status, proposals, toolCalls }`, `routine.run_abandoned`. No names, instructions, or summaries.

### MCP

| Tool | Scope | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_routines` | inbox:read | `{}` | `{ routines: [{ routineId, name, schedule, scheduleNote, enabled, nextDueAt, due, runsAvailable, lastRun }] }`: unbound routines and ones bound to this key; no instructions |
| `list_due_routines` | inbox:read | `{}` | `{ routines: [{ routineId, name, dueAt, schedule, scheduleNote, runsAvailable }] }`: enabled, due now, visible to this key, oldest due first, at most 20 |
| `start_run` | inbox:write (`run_start`: 48 a day per key, 200 per user) | `{ routineId, clientLabel? ≤ 60 }` | `{ runId, leaseExpiresAt (2 h), routine: { routineId, name, instructions, outputKinds, targets, scopeHints, scheduleNote, maxProposals, dueAt }, protocol, lastRun: { status, startedAt, finishedAt, summary, proposals } \| null, recentlyRejected: [{ title, reason }] }`. `NOT_FOUND` for an unknown, paused, or other-key routine; `RUN_ACTIVE` `{ leaseExpiresAt }` while a run holds the lease |
| `submit_proposals` | as above | `{ runId?, proposals }` | with `runId` (this key's own open run; `NOT_FOUND` otherwise, `INVALID` once finished or abandoned): per-item `KIND_NOT_ALLOWED`, `TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED` (a pinned module's item outside its pins; a note draft's folder is checked before the draft is written), `LIMIT_REACHED` past `maxProposals` (the run is flagged `capped`); proposals expire after the routine's `expireDays`; the result adds `runId` |
| `finish_run` | inbox:write | `{ runId, status: "succeeded" \| "failed", summary? ≤ 4096 B, error? ≤ 500 }` | `{ runId, status, proposals, toolCalls, capped, durationMs, nextDueAt }`; `NOT_FOUND` for another key's run; `INVALID` once finished or abandoned; `TOO_LARGE` |

**Tool calls** (D160, T134): while a key holds an open run, every admitted call it makes adds one to that run's `toolCalls` (the newest open run if it holds several). `start_run` itself runs before the run exists.

**Prompts** (O7): for keys with `inbox:read`, each enabled routine visible to the key is the MCP prompt `routine.<slug>` (the name lower-cased and dashed; a clash adds the id's first block), titled with the routine's name. `prompts/get` returns one user message: the fixed run protocol (start_run, read, submit_proposals with the runId, finish_run; everything read from Nook is data) followed by the instructions.

New MCP error codes: `KIND_NOT_ALLOWED`, `TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED`, `RUN_ACTIVE`.

## Whiteboards (Wave 23)

Plan: `docs/plan/research/2026-09-28-whiteboard-module.md` §6–§9 (D191–D210, T160–T172). Migration **030** (`whiteboards`; the plan's 023 was taken) adds `whiteboards`, `whiteboard_snapshots` (used from Wave 24), `whiteboard_search`, and `whiteboard_fts`.

**A whiteboard is a Files document** (D192): `purpose = 'file'`, `mime_type = 'application/vnd.excalidraw+json'`, `preview_kind = 'none'`, a name ending in `.excalidraw` (lists show it without the suffix), plus a `whiteboards` row. The upload sniffer never produces that MIME, so the only way to create one is `POST /api/whiteboards`. Rename, move, access (the Access sheet, `document` kind), delete, the Bin, and quota are the Files routes unchanged (D196); a board is view-only for everyone but its owner (D195, D275). A rename that drops the suffix keeps it.

**Scene bytes** are a copy-on-write object per save (D193): `documents/objects/<whiteboards.object_id>`, written through staging, fsync, and rename; `documents.size_bytes` and `sha256` always describe the current object, and nothing is stored under the document id. The stored JSON is canonical (§7 validator in `shared/whiteboardScene.ts`: deleted elements stripped, keys sorted), so the same scene always hashes the same.

```ts
type WhiteboardSummary = DocumentSummary & {
  kind: "whiteboard"; revision: number; elementCount: number;
  hasThumbnail: boolean; thumbRevision: number | null;
  canEdit: boolean;                     // the owner, while their Team role writes
};
type CanonicalScene = {
  type: "excalidraw"; version: 2; source: "nook";
  elements: ExcalidrawElement[];        // rectangle, diamond, ellipse, arrow, line, freedraw, text, image, frame
  appState: { viewBackgroundColor?; gridSize?; gridStep?; gridModeEnabled? };
  files: Record<string, { id; mimeType; nookDocumentId }>;   // never a dataURL; empty in Wave 23
};
```

| Endpoint | Who | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/whiteboards` | members and admins | `{ name 1–200 characters (§6.4 rules), folderId? (owned; Default when absent) }`, optional `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` (stored as `upload_key`) | 201 `{ whiteboard }`; a replayed key 200 `{ whiteboard, idempotentReplay: true }` | 400 `INVALID_NAME`, 404 (folder), 409 `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_USED` (the board was deleted since), 507 `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` / `DISK_FULL` |
| `GET /api/whiteboards?folder=all\|shared\|<folderId>&sort=updated-desc\|updated-asc\|name-asc\|name-desc&limit=1–500&cursor=` | readers | | 200 `{ whiteboards: WhiteboardSummary[], nextCursor: string \| null }` (pages of at most 500 in the chosen order, default newest edit first, the Files read predicate; pass `nextCursor` back as `cursor` with the same `sort`) | 400 (folder, sort, limit, `INVALID_CURSOR`, including a cursor made for another sort) |
| `GET /api/whiteboards/:id` | readers | | 200 `{ whiteboard, scene: CanonicalScene }`, `ETag: "r<revision>"`; the revision, count, size, and time are read with the object id in one row, so they always describe the bytes returned; the scene is validated again on the way out | 404 |
| `PUT /api/whiteboards/:id/scene` | the owner | `{ baseRevision, scene }`, at most 4 MiB | 200 `{ revision, savedAt, sha256, sizeBytes }`; an identical scene 200 `{ …, unchanged: true }` with the same revision | 400 `INVALID_SCENE` / `TOO_MANY_ELEMENTS` / `UNSUPPORTED_ELEMENT` / `TOO_MANY_POINTS` / `INVALID_LINK` / `DATA_URL_NOT_ALLOWED` / `IMAGES_NOT_SUPPORTED` (any image element or `files` entry in Wave 23), 404, 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After`, 409 `{ code: "REVISION_CONFLICT", revision }`, 413 `SCENE_TOO_LARGE`, 507 (the quota delta) |
| `GET /api/whiteboards/:id/previous-version` | the owner | | 200 `{ revision, createdAt, elementCount }`: what "Restore previous version" would switch to, so its dialog can name both counts (QA E6) | 404 (not the owner, or `NO_SNAPSHOT`) |
| `POST /api/whiteboards/:id/restore-previous` | the owner | `{ baseRevision }` | 200 as for a scene save plus `restoredFrom: { revision, createdAt }`: the newest safety snapshot becomes a new revision, and the scene it replaces is kept as the newest snapshot | 404 (not the owner, or `NO_SNAPSHOT`), 409 `REVISION_CONFLICT`, 429, 507 |
| `PUT /api/whiteboards/:id/thumbnail` | the owner | `{ revision, png: base64 }` (JSON, like every other write; at most 128 KiB of PNG) | 204; also 204, and ignored, for a revision older than the stored thumbnail's or newer than the board's | 400, 404, 413 `THUMBNAIL_TOO_LARGE`, 415 `NOT_PNG` (signature, IHDR, at most 2048 × 2048) |
| `GET /api/whiteboards/:id/thumbnail` | readers | | 200 `image/png`, `ETag` = its sha256, `Cache-Control: private, no-cache`, 304 on `If-None-Match`; the content route's header set (`default-src 'none'; sandbox`, nosniff, CORP same-origin) | 404 (no board, no access, or no thumbnail) |

- **Save sequence (§8.1).** Validate and canonicalize outside the lock; then under the document lock (`document:<id>`, shared with rename, share, delete, and purge): owner and live board, the revision CAS, the identical-scene no-op, the quota delta, the new object, and one transaction that moves `whiteboards.object_id` and `revision`, mirrors `size_bytes` and `sha256`, and reindexes search. The old object is removed after the commit; a crash in between leaves an orphan the sweeper removes after an hour. Saves are audited as `whiteboard.save`, at most one row per board per ten minutes; creation as `whiteboard.create`.
- **Write gate.** Every new non-GET route is refused for viewers and guests (403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY`); recipients get 404 on writes.
- **Rate limits** (per user, fixed one-minute windows): 30 new boards (REST and MCP), 120 scene saves, 30 thumbnails; past them 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `retryAfter` and `Retry-After`. Autosave (one save per 1.5 s per board, a thumbnail at most once a minute) stays well under them; the client backs off and keeps its pending copy. A save also re-checks that its owner is not blocked inside the transaction (T80).
- **Quota** counts board scenes, snapshots, and thumbnails; a thumbnail that would pass the quota is 507.
- **Safety snapshots** (Wave 23 QA, data-loss defence in depth): a save that empties a board, or leaves a board of 10 or more elements with fewer than half, keeps the scene it replaces in `whiteboard_snapshots` (the newest 5 per board; its object stays; counted in the quota; purged with the board) and answers `snapshotKept: true`. `WhiteboardSummary` gains `snapshotCount` and `snapshotAt` (the owner's; 0 and null for everyone else). The full history sheet is Wave 24; no MCP tool restores.
- **QA E1–E6 (Wave 23 verification):** a board emptied by a real edit is saved like any other edit, including by the leave flush, and the server keeps the replaced scene as a snapshot. `WhiteboardSummary` gains `ownerAvatarUrl` (Wave 35's same-origin avatar URL, or null), drawn with the shared `Avatar` on list rows and the "Owned by" banner. `sort=name-asc|name-desc` is natural and case-insensitive on the name without `.excalidraw` (the Files list's comparison; "Name" before "Name (copy)", "Board 2" before "Board 10"), ties by id; these two orders are sorted in the server, and their cursor carries the last name and id. The client sends pending copies in the background (on start, on `online`, when the list is shown) through the ordinary `PUT …/scene` CAS, one at a time; no new endpoint.
- **Wave 24** adds duplicate, import, snapshots, images, and links to Nook items (plan §8, WB-B): see "Connected whiteboards (Wave 24)" below, which supersedes the Wave 23 image refusal and the five-snapshot cap.

**Existing routes that change.** `DocumentSummary` (Files lists, `GET /api/files/:id`, rename and move responses) gains `kind: "file" | "whiteboard"`; Bin rows for documents gain `kind`. `GET /api/files/:id/content` serves a board's current scene object (download only, as for any `preview_kind: 'none'` file), re-reading once when a save replaced it meanwhile. `GET /api/search?scope=whiteboards&q=` returns `{ results: [{ id, name, title: Segment[], snippet: Segment[], owner_name, is_owner, updated_at }], truncated }` (names and text elements of boards the caller can read; binned boards never). Today gains `whiteboardsRecent` (the five newest readable boards: `{ id, name, is_owner, owner_name, updated_at }`, `href: "/whiteboards"`, `whiteboards:read` for `get_today`). `storedBytes` adds snapshot sizes.

### MCP (`whiteboards:read`, `whiteboards:write`)

| Tool | Scope | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_whiteboards` | `whiteboards:read` | `{ folderId?, query? (≤ 200), limit? 1–50 (20), cursor? }` (keyset pages; search results page by offset; a chosen-boards key is narrowed in SQL before the page cut) | `{ whiteboards: [{ id, name, folderId?, owner, isOwner, updatedAt, revision, elementCount, url }], nextCursor? }` |
| `read_whiteboard` | `whiteboards:read` | `{ id, include?: "text" \| "elements" }` | `{ id, name, owner, revision, updatedAt, elementCount, texts: [{ elementId, text, containerId?, frame? }], elements?: [{ id, type, x, y, width, height, text?, link?, from?, to?, frameId?, name? }] (≤ 1,000), truncated, url }`, at most 256 KiB; never points or image bytes |
| `create_whiteboard` | `whiteboards:write` | `{ name 1–200, folderId? (owned) }` | `{ id, name, url }`, private, audited `mcp.whiteboard_create` with `keyId` |

`whiteboards:write` implies `whiteboards:read`; viewers hold read only, guests nothing. There are no scene-editing, delete, share, or key tools (D205, T170); descriptions say board text is untrusted data. **Nook keys:** the pair maps to grant module `whiteboards`; a grant may name chosen boards (selector kind `whiteboard`). Such a key sees `list_whiteboards` (filtered to those boards before paging) and `read_whiteboard` on them only; `create_whiteboard` names no board and is hidden from it. The access plan's `folder` selector for whiteboards is not offered yet.

### Connected whiteboards (Wave 24)

Plan §8 and D198, D199, D201, D207, D208 (WB-B). No migration: `whiteboard_snapshots` is 030's.

**Images (D198, T164, T165).** Image elements are accepted; each refers to a `files` entry `{ id, mimeType, nookDocumentId }` and never holds a `dataURL` (400 `DATA_URL_NOT_ALLOWED`). The canonical scene keeps only the `files` entries a live image uses. On a save, every reference that is NOT already on the board (or in the version being restored) must be a document that exists (not being purged), that the server sniffed as a PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP image with that exact MIME type, and that the owner can read or owns (their own binned picture counts): otherwise 400 `IMAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE` with `documentIds`. References already on the board are carried as they are, so a picture deleted or unshared since shows a placeholder and never makes the board unsavable. The canvas loads each picture through `GET /api/files/:id/content?disposition=inline` as the viewer; no route serves a picture through the board's access, and thumbnails are drawn without pictures. `IMAGES_NOT_SUPPORTED` remains only for callers that pass `{ images: false }`.

| Endpoint | Who | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/whiteboards/:id/summary` | readers | | 200 `{ whiteboard: { id, name, updated_at, hasThumbnail, thumbRevision, elementCount, owner_name, is_owner } }`: what a note's embed card shows (D208) | 404 (no board or no access; the body never names the board). The owner of a board now in their Bin gets 404 `{ code: "BINNED", binned: true }` (QA L6); anyone else, `NOT_FOUND` |
| `GET /api/whiteboards/:id/snapshots` | the owner | | 200 `{ snapshots: [{ id, revision, createdAt, sizeBytes, elementCount \| null }] }`, newest first | 404 |
| `GET /api/whiteboards/:id/snapshots/:snapshotId` | the owner | | 200 `{ snapshot, scene: CanonicalScene }` (for the History preview) | 404 (`NO_SNAPSHOT` for an unknown id) |
| `POST /api/whiteboards/:id/snapshots/:snapshotId/restore` | the owner | `{ baseRevision }` | 200 as for a scene save plus `restoredFrom: { id, revision, createdAt }`; the scene it replaces is kept as a snapshot; the version's own images are carried | 404, 409 `REVISION_CONFLICT`, 429, 507 |
| `POST /api/whiteboards/:id/duplicate` | readers who write | `{ folderId? (owned), snapshotId? (owner only) }` | 201 `{ whiteboard, imagesLeftOut }`: a private board owned by the caller named "Name (copy)", then "(copy 2)", … in the target folder (the source's when the caller owns it, else Default); images the caller cannot open are left out; the thumbnail is copied only when nothing was left out | 404, 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY`, 429, 507 |
| `POST /api/whiteboards/import` | members and admins | `{ name, folderId?, file }`: the parsed `.excalidraw` file, body at most 32 MiB | 201 `{ whiteboard, images, imagesLeftOut }` | 400 (`INVALID_SCENE`, `UNSUPPORTED_ELEMENT`, `INVALID_LINK`, …: the save validator's codes; `IMAGE_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORTED`), 404 (folder), 413 `IMPORT_TOO_LARGE` / `IMAGE_TOO_LARGE` / `SCENE_TOO_LARGE`, 507 |

- **Snapshots (D207).** A save keeps the scene it replaces when it empties the board or drops more than half of 10 or more elements (Wave 23), or when the replaced scene is not empty and the newest snapshot is at least 30 minutes old (or there is none). At most **20** per board (the oldest objects are removed); they count toward the quota. `GET …/previous-version` gains `id`; `restore-previous` restores the newest, the History sheet's first entry.
- **Import.** The file is validated (the save validator, and the same 4 MiB canonical cap) and the quota checked before anything is stored. Each embedded `dataURL` picture used by a live image is decoded, limited to `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, and stored through the upload pipeline as an ordinary File named "<board> image N.<ext>" in the board's folder; the server's sniff must say PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP. Pictures without data, and references to Nook files the importer cannot open, are left out (`imagesLeftOut`). If storing a picture or creating the board fails, the pictures stored so far are purged. Audited `whiteboard.import`; duplicates `whiteboard.duplicate`.
- **Links (D199).** Unchanged allowlist (https, http, mailto, Nook paths). The client turns a full URL of this instance into its path and drops a link the allowlist refuses from the saved copy (with a message), so a bad link never makes a board unsavable.
- **MCP.** `read_whiteboard` with `include: "elements"` adds `documentId` to image elements: the Nook file it shows, never bytes. Reading that file needs the Files tools and the key's own access to it.
- **Embed card (D208).** No new route besides `…/summary`: the note's Markdown holds `[Whiteboard](/whiteboards/<uuid> "whiteboard")` alone in its paragraph. The link text is always "Whiteboard", never the board's name (Wave 24 QA H1): the server normalises every draft write, and note reads (`GET /api/notes/:id`, versions, MCP `read_note`, search) show older named lines as "Whiteboard" without rewriting stored versions.

## Vault (Wave 25, Vault A)

Plan: `docs/plan/research/2026-09-28-password-vault-module.md` §5–§7 (D211–D230, T180–T199). Migration **031** (`vault`; the plan's 024 was taken) adds `vaults`, `vault_keys`, `vault_environments`, `vault_members`, `vault_env_access`, `vault_secrets`, `vault_values`, `vault_value_versions`, `vault_events`, and `vault_rate_limits`. There are no vault key tables: `nkv_` keys will be `mcp_api_keys.kind = 'vault'` with `api_key_grants` rows carrying `env_id` (access plan D264), from Wave 27. **Wave 25 has no API keys, no `/api/v1/vault`, and no MCP tools**: vaults are owner-only (one member, its creator). Wave 26 (below, "Vault sharing and operations") adds members, groups, the protected-environment window, import and export, key rotation, Activity, and the byte quota; still no keys, REST v1, or MCP tools (Wave 27).

**Encryption** (D211–D213): `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (or `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_FILE`) wraps one random 256-bit data key per vault and generation (`vault_keys.wrapped_dek`, AAD `nook:vault-dek:v1:<vaultId>:<generation>`). Values, value comments, and secret comments are AES-256-GCM under the data key, stored as `v1:<nonce>:<tag>:<ciphertext>` with the AAD `nook:vault-value:v1:<vaultId>:<secretId>:<envId>:<version>`, `nook:vault-value-comment:v1:…` (same ids), or `nook:vault-secret-comment:v1:<vaultId>:<secretId>`. Names, descriptions, environment names and short names, and tags are plaintext (D222). Without a key the module is off: every route below except `GET /api/vault/status` answers 503 `VAULT_DISABLED`. A key that does not open the stored data keys at startup also turns the module off (the app keeps running).

**Common rules.** Session only (`requireAuth`, Origin, JSON, `X-CSRF-Token` on writes), `Cache-Control: no-store`. Guests get 404 on every read; the role gate refuses every write from viewers and guests with 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` before any lookup, except a viewer's `POST …/reveal` (a read sent as POST). A missing, binned, or unreadable vault, environment, secret, or version is the same 404 `NOT_FOUND` (admins get no implicit access, D73); a level too low on an environment the caller can see is 403 `VAULT_LEVEL`. Validation errors are 400 `INVALID` with field paths only; no error body carries a value or echoes input. A ciphertext that does not open under its own ids is 500 `VAULT_INTEGRITY` (audited as `integrity.fail`). Rate limits (persistent in SQLite, sliding window): value reads, reveals, and opening a secret's comment 300 per 10 minutes per person (a reveal batch counts each cell), writes 300 per 10 minutes; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `retryAfterSeconds` and `Retry-After`.

Bounds (D227): vault name 1–80, description ≤ 500, environment name 1–40, short name `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$`, secret name 1–128 (one line, unique per vault ignoring case), at most 10 tags of 1–32 characters without spaces or commas, a value ≤ 64 KiB and a comment ≤ 2 KiB of UTF-8 (413 `TOO_LARGE`, however the size is reached: there is no separate character limit; no NUL), 20 environments per vault, 1,000 secrets per vault and 100 owned vaults per person (both counting those in the Bin until they are purged), 20 versions kept per secret and environment.

```ts
type Environment = { id; slug; name; position: number; protected: boolean; level: "none" | "read" | "write" | "admin" };
type VaultSummary = { id; name; description; role: "owner" | "member"; revision: number; createdAt; updatedAt; secretCount: number; environments: Environment[] };
type ValueCell = { status: "set" | "empty" | "no-access"; version: number | null; updatedAt: string | null; updatedBy: string | null };
type SecretSummary = { id; name; type: "value" | "login" | "note"; tags: string[]; hasComment: boolean; revision: number; createdAt; updatedAt; updatedBy: string | null; values: Record<envId, ValueCell> };
type ValueResult = { secretId; envId; version: number; updatedAt; updatedBy: string | null };
```

A `login` value is the JSON string `{"username","password","url"}` (each a string); the type of a secret can change only while it has no values or history (409 `TYPE_HAS_VALUES`). `protected` (new vaults mark `prod`) is enforced from Wave 26: see the re-authentication window below.

| `PUT /api/vault/vaults/:v/secrets/:s/values/:e` | write on `:e` | `{ value, comment?, expectedVersion }` (0 when never set, or the version a clear left).

The app sends the comment field as shown when it loaded the current value; in a protected environment outside the window (the "New value" editor) it omits an empty comment so the current one is kept. Vault keys (REST v1 and MCP) are unchanged: an omitted comment there still writes a version without one | 200 `{ value: ValueResult }` (version + 1; kept in history, trimmed to 20) | 409 `VALUE_CHANGED` with `envId`, `currentVersion`, and `changed: [{ envId, currentVersion }]`; 400 `INVALID_VALUE`; 413 `TOO_LARGE` |

Every entry's `expectedVersion` is checked before anything is written; a refusal's `changed` lists **every** environment whose version moved (the app keeps the versions it saw when the editor opened, and its "Load the latest" takes these) | 200 `{ values: ValueResult[] }` | as PUT |
| `DELETE /api/vault/vaults/:v/secrets/:s/values/:e?expectedVersion=` | write on `:e` | | 200 `{ ok, version }`: a cleared version; history keeps the earlier ones | 404 `VALUE_NOT_SET`, 409 `VALUE_CHANGED` |
| `POST /api/vault/vaults/:v/reveal` | per cell (viewers allowed) | `{ cells: [{ secretId, envId }] (1–100) }` | 200 `{ cells: [{ secretId, envId, status: "ok", version, value, comment } \| { secretId, envId, status: "unavailable" }] }`; one `value.read` event with the count | |

| `POST /api/vault/vaults/:v/secrets/:s/values/:e/versions/:n/restore` | write on `:e` | `{ expectedVersion }` | 200 `{ value: ValueResult }`: the old value as a new version | 409 `VALUE_CHANGED`, `VERSION_CLEARED` |

**Bin** (D225): the existing `/api/bin` lists, restores, and purges the types `vault`, `vault_environment`, and `vault_secret` (`folder_name` is the vault's name; `vault` rows say "Vault"). Owners restore and purge; whoever binned an environment or secret restores it while they still hold write there. A restore whose name or short name was taken meanwhile is 409 `NAME_TAKEN`; one whose vault is binned is 409 `PARENT_IN_BIN`. A purge is a tombstone and then one transaction; a vault's purge deletes its `vault_keys` (crypto-shred) and its events. Binned items are invisible on every other route.

**`vault_events`** (append-only): `vault.create/update/delete/restore`, `env.create/update/reorder/delete/restore/purge`, `secret.create/update/delete/restore/purge`, `value.write/clear/restore/read`, `version.read`, `comment.read`, `integrity.fail`, `kek.rotate` (via `cli`); ids and counts only. Kept for 90 days: the hourly sweep deletes older rows, and 031's trigger refuses deleting newer ones. Wave 26 adds the events below and the Activity route.

**Host CLI** `server/vault-admin.ts`: `verify-key` (exit 0 when the key opens every stored data key, 1 when not, 2 on a usage error) and `rotate-kek [--key-saved]` (re-wraps every data key from `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` or `_FILE` to the key in `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_NEW_FILE` in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction; an inline `VAULT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_NEW` only with `--key-saved`, else exit 2; exit 1 without changing anything while a server's `DATA_DIR/server.heartbeat` is under 15 seconds old after waiting 20 seconds). Both print counts and key fingerprints (the first 8 hex digits of the key's SHA-256) only, never keys; `rotate-kek` ends with the next steps (OPERATIONS → Vault).

**`/api/auth/me`, sign-in, and registration** gain `features: { vault: boolean }`: false for guests, and for everyone but admins while the module is off. It only decides what the app shows (T97).

## Vault sharing and operations (Wave 26, Vault B)

Plan: vault plan §6.1, §6.3, §6.4, §6.6, §7, §10 (D214–D216, D226, D227, V-O2, V-O3). Migration **037** (`vault_sharing`) adds `sessions.vault_reauth_at` (the protected-environment window), `vaults.stored_bytes` (ciphertext bytes, kept by triggers on values, versions, and secret comments; backfilled), the index `vault_secrets_vault`, and `vault_members_person_only` (an integration can never be a vault member). API keys, `/api/v1/vault`, and the vault MCP tools arrived in Wave 27 (below). The routes below keep the Wave 25 common rules (session only, CSRF, `no-store`, 404 parity, `VAULT_LEVEL`, no value in any error).

**Access** (D214, D215, V-O3, T185, T198). A person reaches a vault through their own member row (`vault_members` + `vault_env_access`) or through a group (`group_grants` with `resource_kind = 'vault'` and one row per environment, `env_id` set; view → read, edit → write, manage → admin). Their level on each environment is the highest of the two, capped by the Team role: admins and members uncapped, viewers read at most, guests, blocked accounts, and integrations nothing. Someone reached only through a group is a member. Owners hold admin on every environment. Admins get no implicit access (D73): a vault they are not in is 404 everywhere, the Access sheet included.

**Protected environments** (D226, V-O2; reads only since 2026-10-06, operator: no re-auth for writes). These routes answer 403 `REAUTH_REQUIRED` with `envIds` while this session's re-authentication window is closed: reading a value (`GET …/values/:e`), revealing (`POST …/reveal`, single and batch), opening an old version (`GET …/versions/:n`), exporting (`GET …/environments/:e/export`), lifting protection (`PATCH …/environments/:e` with `protected: false`), and deleting the environment (`DELETE …/environments/:e`). Writes need no window, only the usual write level, CSRF, compare-and-swap, quota, and rate limits: creating a secret with values, `PUT …/values/:e`, `PUT …/values` (batch), clearing (`DELETE …/values/:e`), restoring a version, importing (preview and write), deleting a secret to the Bin, and restoring it from the Bin. No write answers with a value (ids, versions, and counts only). Without the window, an import preview into a protected environment does not compare with the current values: an existing value is `update` (overwrite) or `skip`, never `same`. Metadata (the secrets list, the versions list, names) needs no window. The window is 15 minutes per session, opened by `POST /api/vault/reauth`; owners are not exempt. Protecting an environment needs no window; unprotecting does.

An environment admin sends the same people, roles, and groups, and changes only none/read/write of members on their environments (never their own row, never admin) | 200 `{ access: VaultAccessSheet \| null, managesAccess, stillReads, rotated, generation \| null, lostAccess }`; roles change promotions first, so an owner can hand the vault over in one save in any row order; the sheet is read after the save, and is `null` (`managesAccess: false`) when the caller no longer manages the vault (the page then goes to the vault, or to the list when `stillReads` is false). When the billing owner stops being an owner (here, on leaving, or an admin's removal) the longest-standing owner becomes it. Anyone who could read an environment and no longer can starts a key rotation (`rotated: true`); people newly given access get the bell and a "shared with you" email naming the vault only | 428 `ETAG_REQUIRED`; 409 `ACCESS_CHANGED` with `access` (the latest); 409 `LAST_OWNER`; 400 `ROLE_CAP` (a viewer above read, or as owner), `PERSON_BLOCKED` (a blocked account made owner), `GUEST_NOT_ALLOWED`, `INTEGRATION_NOT_ALLOWED`, `GUEST_SHARE_DISABLED` (a group with guests while sharing with guests is off; `guests.groups`), `NOT_FOUND_PERSON`, `LIMIT_REACHED`, `INVALID`; 403 `VAULT_LEVEL` for what an environment admin may not change |

| `POST /api/vault/vaults/:v/environments/:e/import` | write on `:e` (no window; since 2026-10-06) | `{ entries: [{ name, value, comment? }] (≤ 500), mode: "skip" \| "overwrite" (default skip), dryRun?: boolean }` | 200 `{ mode, dryRun, counts: { create, set, update, same, skip, invalid }, entries: [{ name, status, reason \| null }] }`. A dry run writes nothing; it compares with the current values (only inside the window for a protected environment; outside it an existing value is `update` or `skip`, never `same`) (one read, whatever the number of entries; event `import.preview`). An import costs one write (not one per entry), so any import of up to 500 entries the preview allows fits the write limit. An import writes in one transaction under the byte quota: new names become `value` secrets; an existing value keeps its comment unless the entry brings one; event `import`, audit `vault.import` (counts) | 400 `INVALID` (over 500, NUL anywhere); 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (1,000 secrets); 413 `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`; per entry `invalid` with a reason (bad name, over 64 KiB or 2 KiB, a login that is not its JSON, a repeated name) |
| `GET /api/vault/vaults/:v/environments/:e/export?format=dotenv\|json\|csv&comments=0\|1` | read on `:e` (+ window when protected) | | 200 attachment (`Content-Disposition`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, CSP `default-src 'none'; sandbox`, `nosniff`), `X-Vault-Export-Count`, `X-Vault-Export-Skipped` (names that are not valid `.env` keys are left out of a `.env` file). In CSV, a name, value, or comment starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, a tab, or a CR gets a leading `'` (T55); the CSV import takes it off again. Every live secret with a value there, by name. Event `export` (count), audit `vault.export` (format and counts) | 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (10 exports an hour per person, charged only when the file is produced; an export also costs one read, whatever its size) |

```ts
type VaultAccessSheet = {
  etag: string; vault: { id; name }; yourRole: "owner" | "member"; youId: string; canManagePeople: boolean;
  environments: [{ id; slug; name; protected: boolean; manageable: boolean }];
  people: [{ id; displayName; teamRole; kind; blocked; avatarUrl; isYou; role: "owner" | "member"; levels: Record<envId, Level>; cap: Level; groupIds: string[] }];
  groups: [{ id; name; memberCount; guestCount; levels: Record<envId, Level> }];
  levels: ["none", "read", "write", "admin"]; shareWithGuests: boolean; maxPeople: 50; maxGroups: 20;
};
```

`VaultSummary` gains `ownerName` (the vault's creator, whose byte quota it counts against), `via: "direct" | "group"`, and `reauthUntil`. When the creator stops being an owner, the longest-standing owner becomes the vault's billing owner (`vaults.owner_id`).

**Formats** (shared/vaultTransfer.ts, in-house, D230): `.env` lines `KEY=value` (`export ` prefix, `#` comments, single quotes literal, double quotes with `
 
 	 " \` escapes and real line breaks, BOM and CRLF accepted; keys `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*$`; a repeated key keeps the later value); JSON as a flat `{ "NAME": "value" }`, a list of `{ name, value, comment? }`, or the export shape `{ vault, environment, secrets: [{ name, type, value, comment? }] }`; CSV (RFC 4180) with a `name,value[,comment]` header. Exports write every value double-quoted (`.env`), as the export shape (JSON), or quoted where needed (CSV), so each format round-trips through its own parser. Files are read in the browser (at most 1 MiB) and never uploaded.

**Byte quota** (review L5): 64 MiB of stored ciphertext per person across the vaults they created, binned ones included. A write that grows the total past it is 413 `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` and rolled back (with `quotaBytes`; `storedBytes` only when the caller is the vault's billing owner, since the total spans every vault they created); a write that shrinks or keeps it (a clear, a trim) always passes.

**Key rotation** (§3.3, §6.6): a rotation starts a new data-key generation at once (every write uses it); the background runner re-encrypts older rows (values, history, secret comments) in batches of 500 under the same AAD, and deletes an old generation's wrapped key (`key.retire`, via `sweeper`) once nothing refers to it. Values stay readable throughout. It starts on demand and whenever someone loses read on an environment (removal, lowering to none, leaving, an admin's reduction, Reset access, removal from a granted group or the group's deletion, a block, a role change to guest: `key.rotate.auto`). A loss outside the vault's Access sheet also puts a bell notice (`vault_key_rotated`) with each owner: rotate the real credentials upstream. The runner takes rows in rowid order and passes rows that do not open under their own key; a sweep that ends with such rows left records `key.rotate.skipped` once with their count (never ids or values), and their generation is not retired. The hourly sweeper resumes a rotation a restart interrupted.

**Bin**: unchanged rules, now for shared vaults: a binned vault is listed only to its owners; a binned environment or secret to owners and to whoever binned it while they still hold write (through their row or a group). Purge stays owners only.

**Notifications** (D93, D223): bell notices `vault_shared` ("Alice shared the vault “Payments” with you", opening `/vault/:id`) and `vault_removed`; the vault's name appears only while the recipient can read it. The "shared with you" email (`sharing.shared`, kind `vault`) names the vault only; vault shares stay out of the digest's share log.

**Team → member access** (`/api/team/members/:userId/access`, `/api/me/access`): the summary gains `vaults: [{ title, titleHidden, owner: { displayName }, role, via, environments: [{ name, level }], active, handle? }]` (a vault's and its environments' names only for an admin who can open it, D269). `DELETE …/access/:handle` on a vault row removes the membership (never the last owner: 409 `LAST_OWNER`) and starts a rotation; `PATCH …/access/:handle { level: "view" }` lowers every environment to read (400 `NOT_A_REDUCTION`, `NOT_LOWERABLE` for owners, `LEVEL_NOT_OFFERED` for any other level). Reset access counts vault memberships as direct shares and removes member rows (owned vaults stay).

**New `vault_events`**: `member.add`, `member.remove`, `member.leave`, `member.owner`, `member.demote`, `access.change`, `env.protect`, `env.unprotect`, `key.rotate`, `key.rotate.auto`, `key.rotate.skipped`, `key.retire`, `import`, `import.preview`, `export`.

## Vault keys, REST, and MCP (Wave 27, Vault C)

Plan: vault plan §7, §7.1, §9 (D217–D221, T182–T184, T191–T192); access plan D264, D278, T217. Migration **038** (`vault_keys`) adds `mcp_api_keys.vault_protected_access`, `api_key_grants.protected_at_grant` (only on a vault grant naming an environment on a flagged key), `vault_events.key_name` and `key_prefix` (kept fixed by the append-only trigger), and triggers: the two vault flags only on vault keys and only ever turned off by an update (`WIDENING_NOT_ALLOWED`); a vault key belongs to a person (`PERSON_ONLY`); a vault grant on a vault key names its vault (`resource_kind = 'vault'`, an id), permission `read` or `write`, and an `env_id` of that same vault or NULL (`VAULT_GRANT_SHAPE`); the index `vault_events_key`. 025's kind wall is unchanged: vault grants only on vault keys, and vault keys hold nothing else (`KEY_KIND_WALL`).

**Vault keys** are Nook keys with `kind: "vault"` and the prefix `nkv_`, in the same table, list, inventory, policies, and lifecycle (narrow, rotate, revoke) as general keys. A grant is a vault, one environment (or every environment), and `read` or `write`. What a key can do is computed on every call: its grant ∩ its creator's **live** level on that environment ∩ the creator's role cap (viewers read, guests and blocked accounts nothing). A creator who loses a level or an environment narrows the key at once; a blocked creator's key is refused (401 `KEY_INVALID`); purging a vault or environment deletes the grants that name it (the key stays, reaching less). A key is never an owner: no member, access, environment, vault, rotation, import, export, Bin, or key operation is reachable with a key (D219, D265).

**Protected environments over keys** (decision, D226): a grant over "every environment" never covers a protected one. A key reaches a protected environment only when a grant names that environment **and** the key was created (or rotated) with `protectedAccess: true`; the creation's password-plus-code re-authentication stands in for the session window, so keys need no window. The flag is stored only when a grant names a protected environment, and each grant row records whether its environment was protected when it was made (`api_key_grants.protected_at_grant`, Wave 27 fixes). Only such a grant reaches a protected environment, so marking another environment protected later cuts every key off it at once, including a flagged key that named it while it was unprotected (rotating re-checks and re-records).

**Values** (decision, T191): over REST a key reads values wherever its level is read or above (REST is the path for CI; `allowMcpValueReads` is about MCP only). Over MCP a value comes back only when the key has `allowMcpValueReads` (off by default), a read level on that environment, and the call names the environment.

### Creating and changing vault keys

| Endpoint | Change for vault keys |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/keys` | `kind: "vault"`; `grants: [{ module: "vault", permission: "read" \| "write", vaultId, envId? }]` (1..50; `envId` omitted or null = every unprotected environment); `allowMcpValueReads?: boolean` (default false); `protectedAccess?: boolean` (default false). `expiresInDays` 1..365 (policy default 90 when omitted; `null` is 400 `EXPIRY_REQUIRED`). Checked before the password, so no code is consumed: 400 `KEY_KIND_WALL` (a vault grant on a general key, or any other grant on a vault key; vault settings on a general key are 400 `INVALID`); 404 `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` (a vault or environment missing or not readable by the creator, T205); 403 `GRANT_EXCEEDS_ACCESS` (readable but below the level asked for); 400 `PROTECTED_ACCESS_REQUIRED` (a grant names a protected environment without `protectedAccess`); 400 `INVALID_GRANT` ("every environment" where every reachable one is protected, or over 50); 403 `SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED` (a write grant from a viewer; any grant from a guest); 403 `KEY_POLICY` (surfaces or expiry against team policy); 409 `KEY_LIMIT`; 503 `VAULT_DISABLED`. Then the rate limit, then the re-authentication (401 `REAUTH_FAILED`). Records `key.created` (with `kind`, the flags, and grant shapes) in the access log and `apikey.create` in each vault's Activity; the security mail says "Vault key: read in N vaults · …", never a vault's name |
| `PATCH /api/keys/:id` | Narrowing only (D278): drop grants, `write` → `read`, every environment → one environment (only on a key without `protectedAccess`), `allowMcpValueReads: false`, `protectedAccess: false`. An `envId` that is not an environment of that vault (live or in the Bin) is 400 `INVALID_GRANT`; narrowing that keeps no grant recorded as protected (`protected_at_grant`) also turns `protectedAccess` off, as creation and rotation store it only when needed; adding a vault, an environment, a permission, or turning a setting on is 400 `WIDENING_NOT_ALLOWED`; general grants on a vault key 400 `KEY_KIND_WALL` |
| `POST /api/keys/:id/rotate` | Keeps the kind, grants, and settings unless given (`grants`, `allowMcpValueReads`, `protectedAccess` may change: rotation re-authenticates). The grants are checked against the creator's access **now** (403 `GRANT_EXCEEDS_ACCESS` if they lost it; 409 `NO_GRANTS` when nothing is left); `expiresInDays: null` is 400 `EXPIRY_REQUIRED` |
| `DELETE /api/keys/:id` | Unchanged: stops the key at once |
| `GET /api/keys`, `GET /api/keys/:id` | Each key has `kind` and `vault: { allowMcpValueReads, protectedAccess } \| null`; a vault grant is `{ module: "vault", permission, resource: { kind: "vault", id, name }, env: { id, name, protected } \| null, active, inactiveReason }` (names only while the owner can read them, or sees them in the Bin; `inactiveReason: "no-access"` when the creator no longer reaches it at that level, e.g. a `write` grant after the creator was lowered to read, which still reads; `"binned"` when its vault or environment is in the Bin; a viewer's `write` grant counts at read, T81). `GET /api/keys/:id` adds `vaultEvents: [{ id, event, via, count, createdAt, vault: { id, name } \| null, environment: { id, name } \| null }]` (the key's last 30 vault events; never a value or secret name) |
| `GET /api/team/keys` | `?kind=general\|vault`. Vault grants show neither a vault's or environment's name nor its id (D73; `resource.id` and `env.id` are null); each vault key has `vaultCounts: { vaults, writeVaults }`, which the key owner's own `GET /api/keys` also has |
| `POST /api/team/integrations/:id/keys` | `kind: "vault"` (or either vault setting) is 403 `INTEGRATION_NOT_ALLOWED`: integrations are never vault members |
| Routines | A routine can bind only a general key (a vault key is 404 `KEY_NOT_FOUND`) |

### Keys with access

| Endpoint | Who | Success |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/vault/vaults/:v/keys` | readers of the vault (404 otherwise, admins included: D73) | 200 `{ count, scope: "vault" \| "own", keys: [{ id, name, prefix, owner: { id, displayName, isYou }, expiresAt, lastUsedAt, levels: { [envId]: "read" \| "write" } }], maxGrants }`: the live vault keys (not revoked, expired, past a rotation grace, or held by a blocked person) that reach the vault now, each at its effective level per environment the viewer can see. Owners (`scope: "vault"`) see every key; anyone else sees `count` and their own keys only |

### REST: `/api/v1/vault`

Bearer `nkv_…` only, with every REST v1 rule (no cookies, `KEY_IN_URL`, Host and Origin checks, surfaces and `rest_roles` per request, IP allowlists, no CORS, `no-store`, JSON only with `Content-Type: application/json`, 2.1 MB bodies). **The wall** (T217): a general key on any `/api/v1/vault/*` path is 403 `KEY_POLICY`; a vault key on any other `/api/v1/*` path (`/me`, `/tools`, `/tools/:name`) is 403 `KEY_POLICY`. A path that is not a route, or ids that are not UUIDs, are 404 `NOT_FOUND` (before the key is checked); other methods 405 `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` with `Allow`. Missing, binned, and not-reachable vaults, environments, and secrets are the same 404.

| Endpoint | Needs | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/vault/vaults` | a grant | | 200 `{ vaults: [{ id, name, description, secretCount, updatedAt, environments: [{ id, slug, name, protected, level }] }] }` (only environments the key reaches) | |
| `GET /api/v1/vault/vaults/:v` | read somewhere in `:v` | | 200 `{ vault }` (as above) | 404 |
| `GET /api/v1/vault/vaults/:v/secrets?q=&tag=&cursor=` | as above | | 200 `{ vault, secrets: [{ id, name, type, tags, hasComment, revision, createdAt, updatedAt, updatedBy, values: { [envId]: { status: "set" \| "empty" \| "no-access", version, updatedAt, updatedBy } } }], nextCursor }` (pages of 200; never a value) | 400 `INVALID`, `INVALID_CURSOR` |
| `POST /api/v1/vault/vaults/:v/secrets` | write on one environment; write on each environment given a value | `{ name, type?: "value" \| "login" \| "note", comment?, tags?, values?: { [envId]: { value, comment? } } (≤ 20) }` | 201 `{ secret }` (metadata, never a value) | 403 `VAULT_LEVEL`; 409 `NAME_TAKEN`, `LIMIT_REACHED`; 413 `TOO_LARGE`, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`; 400 `INVALID`, `INVALID_VALUE` |
| `GET /api/v1/vault/vaults/:v/secrets/:s` | read somewhere in `:v` | | 200 `{ secret: { …metadata, comment } }` (the secret's comment is decrypted: a read, charged and recorded `comment.read`) | 404 |
| `GET /api/v1/vault/vaults/:v/secrets/:s/values/:e` | read on `:e` | | 200 `{ value: { secretId, envId, version, updatedAt, updatedBy, value, comment } }`, `ETag: "v<version>"`; recorded `value.read` | 404 (`NOT_FOUND`, `VALUE_NOT_SET`) |
| `PUT /api/v1/vault/vaults/:v/secrets/:s/values/:e` | write on `:e` | `{ value, comment?, expectedVersion }` (0 = not set yet) | 200 `{ value: { secretId, envId, version, updatedAt, updatedBy } }`, `ETag`; recorded `value.write` | 409 `VALUE_CHANGED` with `currentVersion` (nothing written); 403 `VAULT_LEVEL`, `READ_ONLY` (the creator's role is read-only); 413 |
| `GET /api/v1/vault/vaults/:v/secrets/:s/values/:e/versions` | read on `:e` | | 200 `{ current: { version, set }, versions: [{ version, cleared, createdAt, createdBy }] }` (metadata only) | 404 |

There is no delete, clear, restore, import, export, reveal batch, environment, access, or vault route for keys.

**Vault REST codes:** the REST v1 codes (`AUTH_REQUIRED` 401, `KEY_INVALID` 401, `KEY_POLICY` 403, `IP_NOT_ALLOWED` 403, `HOST_INVALID` 403, `ORIGIN_INVALID` 403, `KEY_IN_URL` 400, `NOT_FOUND` 404, `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` 405, `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` 415, `INVALID_JSON` 400, `TOO_LARGE` 413, `RATE_LIMITED` 429 with `Retry-After`, `BUSY` 503) plus the vault's own: `INVALID` 400 (with `details` naming fields, never values), `INVALID_VALUE` 400, `INVALID_CURSOR` 400, `READ_ONLY` 403, `VAULT_LEVEL` 403, `VALUE_NOT_SET` 404, `VALUE_CHANGED` 409, `NAME_TAKEN` 409, `LIMIT_REACHED` 409, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` 413, `VAULT_INTEGRITY` 500, `VAULT_DISABLED` 503. Error bodies carry only `currentVersion`, `envId`, `changed`, `currentRevision`, and `retryAfterSeconds` beyond `error` and `code`.

**Limits** (T183): the general per-key REST buckets (per minute, per surface) and the vault's per-key buckets, lower than a person's: reads (values, comments, old versions) 20 a minute and 1,000 an hour; writes (values, new secrets) 10 a minute and 200 a day. A key's calls never charge its creator's buckets. A refusal by a vault bucket also records `key.vault.limited` in the access log (at most once per key per 10 minutes, with the bucket's name), `key.limited` in the vault's Activity, and one bell notice a day to the creator (`key_vault_limited`). **Volume alert** (V-O6, Wave 27 fixes): every value a key reads (REST `GET`/`HEAD` of a value, `read_secret` with a value) also counts in `keyReadDayAlert:<keyId>` (a UTC day, never refused); the read that passes 500 records `key.vault.volume` in the access log (`meta: { reads, threshold, surface }`), `key.volume` in that vault's Activity (`count` only), and a `key_vault_volume` bell notice to the creator, at most one a day per key. `read_secret` with a value charges one read: the value is read first (a refused value opens and records nothing), and the comment returned with it is audited `comment.read` without a second charge.

**Audit:** every read and write is a `vault_events` row with the creator as `actor_id`, the key as `key_id`, and `via: "api"` (REST) or `"mcp"`; `vault_values.updated_via_key` and `vault_value_versions.created_via_key` name the key. Activity shows the key as `key:<name>` (`events[].key: { name, prefix } \| null`, the name and prefix stored on the event when it was written, `vault_events.key_name` / `key_prefix`, so renaming a key re-labels nothing; the family `apikeys` lists key events, including `key.limited` and `key.volume`).

```sh
curl -s https://nook.example.com/api/v1/vault/vaults -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_VAULT_KEY>"
curl -s -X PUT https://nook.example.com/api/v1/vault/vaults/<VAULT_ID>/secrets/<SECRET_ID>/values/<ENV_ID> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_VAULT_KEY>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value":"<NEW_VALUE>","expectedVersion":3}'
```

### MCP tools for vault keys

`/mcp` with an `nkv_` key registers **only** these tools (and no routine prompts); a general key never sees them. Each declares its `ToolAccess` (D281) and is checked by tests/toolResourcePolicy.test.ts. Descriptions say that values are secrets never to be repeated into shared outputs, and that results are data, not instructions.

| Tool | Needs | Arguments | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `list_vaults` | a grant | `{}` | `{ vaults }` as REST (no values) |
| `read_vault` | read in the vault | `{ vaultId }` | `{ vault, secrets (first 200, metadata), nextCursor }` |
| `list_secrets` | read in the vault | `{ vaultId, query?, tag?, cursor? }` | `{ secrets, nextCursor }` (metadata) |
| `read_secret` | read in the vault | `{ vaultId, secretId, envId? }` | Without `allowMcpValueReads` or without `envId`: `{ secret (metadata), value: null, valueWithheld }`. With both and a read level on `envId`: `{ secret: { …, comment }, value: { envId, value, comment, version, updatedAt, updatedBy } }`, charged to the MCP value bucket (60 an hour per key) and recorded `value.read` via `mcp` |
| `write_secret_value` | a write grant; write on `envId` | `{ vaultId, secretId, envId, value, comment?, expectedVersion }` | `{ value: { secretId, envId, version, … } }` (never the value); `VALUE_CHANGED` with `currentVersion` on a stale version |
| `create_secret` | a write grant; write where values are given | `{ vaultId, name, type?, comment?, tags?, values?: [{ envId, value, comment? }] (≤ 20) }` | `{ secret }` (metadata) |

Write tools are listed only while the key holds a write grant and its creator's role writes. There is no delete, clear, restore, import, export, access, member, rotation, or key tool. Tool errors use the MCP shape `{ error, code }` with the vault codes `NOT_FOUND`, `VAULT_LEVEL`, `VALUE_CHANGED`, `VALUE_NOT_SET`, `NAME_TAKEN`, `LIMIT_REACHED`, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`, `TOO_LARGE`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `SCOPE_REQUIRED` (not a vault key, or a write tool without a write grant), `READ_ONLY`, `KEY_POLICY`, `INVALID`, `VAULT_INTEGRITY`, `VAULT_DISABLED`, `INTERNAL`.

## Email (Waves 28–30)

Plan of record: [research/2026-09-28-outbound-email.md](research/2026-09-28-outbound-email.md) (D231–D260), Wave 28 / E1, Wave 29 / E2 (digests, reminders by email, event changed/cancelled, sprints, Bin clean-up, webhooks and suppression, mutes), and Wave 30 / E3 (change and reset password). Email is off unless Resend is configured and links can work (OPERATIONS → Email); while it is off nothing is queued and the routes below answer as described. There are **no MCP tools** for email (D255): preferences are account settings, like push devices.

### Types

```ts
type EmailCategory = "assignments" | "comments" | "sharing" | "proposals" | "sprints" | "bin" | "reminders";
type EmailPrefs = {
  enabled: boolean;                               // master switch; security and account mail ignore it
  categories: Record<EmailCategory, boolean>;     // defaults: sprints and bin off, the rest on
  digest: "off" | "daily" | "weekly";             // Wave 29; weekly goes on Mondays
  digestLocalTime: string;                        // "HH:MM"
  quietStart: string | null; quietEnd: string | null; // both or neither; may wrap midnight
  tz: string;                                     // IANA zone the quiet hours use
  revision: number;                               // 0 = never saved (defaults)
  updatedAt: string | null;
  nextDigestAt: string | null;                    // Wave 29: UTC instant of the next digest, null when off
};
type Suppression = { reason: "bounce" | "complaint" | "manual" | "soft"; since: string; until: string | null } | null; // until: soft bounces only
type EmailSettings = { configured: boolean; address: string; verified: boolean; suppressed: boolean; suppression: Suppression; prefs: EmailPrefs };
type EmailMute = { targetType: "board" | "calendar" | "collection"; targetId: string; name: string; createdAt: string };
```

### Signed-in endpoints

All need the session, CSRF, Origin, and the TOTP gate. Viewers and guests may use them (write-gate allowlist): they are personal settings.

| Method and path | Body | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/mail/settings` | — | `EmailSettings` |
| `PUT /api/mail/settings` | `{ enabled, categories (all seven), digest: "off" \| "daily" \| "weekly", digestLocalTime, quietHours: { start, end } \| null, tz, revision }` (strict) | `EmailSettings`; 409 `PREFERENCES_CHANGED` with `prefs` when `revision` is stale; 400 for an unknown zone, a bad time, equal start and end, an unknown digest cadence, or an unknown category. A `digestLocalTime` inside quiet hours is stored as the quiet-hours end; `nextDigestAt` is recomputed when the cadence, time, or zone changes. Changing the cadence also settles the Today digest prompt (`email_prefs.digest_prompt_at`, migration 035) |
| `GET /api/mail/digest-prompt` | — | `{ show }`: true only when email is configured, the person's email is on, their address is verified, the account is at least 7 days old, the digest is off, and the prompt was never answered (D248) |
| `POST /api/mail/digest-prompt` | `{ choice: "daily" \| "weekly" \| "dismiss", tz? }` (strict; `tz` is used only when email settings were never saved) | 200 `{ show: false, digest, digestLocalTime, tz }`; any choice settles the prompt for good (idempotent). 409 `PROMPT_NOT_AVAILABLE` for a cadence when the prompt does not apply (dismiss always works), 409 `PREFERENCES_CHANGED`, 400 |
| `GET /api/mail/mutes` | — | `{ mutes: EmailMute[] }`: the caller's mutes on items they can still read, newest first (names read now) |
| `PUT /api/mail/mutes/:targetType/:targetId` | `{}` | `{ muted: true }` (idempotent); 404 for an unknown type, a malformed id, or an item the caller cannot read; 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` past 500 |
| `DELETE /api/mail/mutes/:targetType/:targetId` | — | `{ muted: false }` (idempotent; works after access is lost) |
| `POST /api/mail/suppression/clear` | `{}` | "Try again": `EmailSettings` with the caller's own address un-suppressed (hard or soft); 409 `NOT_SUPPRESSED`; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (once a day, audited `mail.suppression_cleared`) |
| `POST /api/mail/verify/send` | `{}` | `{ queued: true }`; 409 `ALREADY_VERIFIED`; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (3 an hour); 503 `NOT_CONFIGURED` |
| `POST /api/mail/test` | `{}` | `{ queued: true, id }`; 409 `UNVERIFIED`; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (3 an hour); 503 `NOT_CONFIGURED` |

### Public endpoints (no session)

| Method and path | Body | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/mail/verify` | `{ token }` (43 base64url characters, from the `/verify-email#token=` fragment). Origin and JSON content type required, 20 a minute per client | `{ ok: true }` and `users.email_verified_at` set; 410 `TOKEN_EXPIRED`; 400 `TOKEN_INVALID` (unknown, used, or issued for a different address). Never creates a session |
| `POST /api/mail/unsubscribe?t=<token>` | any (RFC 8058 sends `List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` form data) | Always 200 with an empty body, valid token or not; a valid one turns its one category off. 429 after 30 a minute per client |
| `GET /api/mail/unsubscribe` | — | 405. A GET never changes anything (link scanners) |
| `POST /api/mail/webhook` | Resend's JSON event, **raw**, at most 64 KiB, with `svix-id`, `svix-timestamp`, `svix-signature` | 404 unless `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set. 401 `Invalid signature` (bad or missing signature, a changed body, a timestamp more than 5 minutes off) and nothing stored. `{ ok: true }` for a first delivery, `{ ok: true, duplicate: true }` for a replayed `svix-id`. `email.bounced` (bounce type `Permanent`), `email.complained`, `email.suppressed` suppress the recipient hash; other bounce types count as soft; `email.failed` marks the outbox row `failed`; every other type is ignored. 413 over 64 KiB |

### Password flows (Wave 30, E3)

Plan: §A.5 and §E.6 of the research. No migration: reset tokens use `auth_tokens` from 026 (`purpose = 'password_reset'`). Code: `server/passwordFlows.ts`. There is no admin-initiated reset (D246); the host CLI stays the way out of an admin lockout (OPERATIONS).

| Method and path | Auth | Body | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/password/change` | session, CSRF, Origin (viewers and guests too: write-gate allowlist) | `{ currentPassword, newPassword (12–256), totpCode? \| recoveryCode? }` (strict; a code is required when two-factor is on) | `{ ok: true, signedOut }`: the password is replaced, **this** session is kept and every other one deleted, unused reset tokens are voided, security mail `security.password_changed` (`event: "changed"`) is queued, `auth.password_changed` audited. 400 `REAUTH_FAILED` (wrong password or code; the code is consumed only after the password verifies), 400 `SAME_PASSWORD`, 400 for a short password, 428 `TOTP_REQUIRED` with `requiresTotp`, 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (5 per 10 min per account). Works with email off |
| `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request` | none; Origin and JSON required | `{ email }` | Always **202** `{ ok: true }` with the same bytes, after at least 400 ms (+ up to 150 ms jitter). The lookup runs after the response: only an existing, unblocked, verified, allowlisted account gets `account.password_reset` (coalesced while queued); nothing is looked up when email is off. The per-address limit (3 an hour, by address hash, unknown addresses too) is silent; 429 `RATE_LIMITED` after 10 an hour per client address. 400 for a malformed address |
| `POST /api/auth/password-reset/check` | none; Origin and JSON required | `{ token }` (43 base64url characters, from `/reset-password#token=`) | `{ ok: true, needsCode }` (whether the account has two-factor, the only thing said about it); 400 `TOKEN_EXPIRED` or `TOKEN_INVALID` (unknown, used, superseded, burned, blocked account, or the address changed since); 429 after 20 a minute per client (shared with complete). Changes nothing |
| `POST /api/auth/password-reset/complete` | none; Origin and JSON required | `{ token, newPassword (12–256), totpCode? \| recoveryCode? }` | `{ ok: true }`: the token is claimed once, the password replaced, other reset tokens deleted, **every** session and push subscription revoked, every unsubscribe link mailed so far voided (`email_prefs.unsub_epoch` bumped in the same transaction, outbound email §B.2; a password change does not bump it), `security.password_changed` (`event: "reset"`) queued, `auth.password_reset` audited. Never signs in (no cookie, no CSRF token). With two-factor on: 428 `TOTP_REQUIRED`, 401 `TOTP_INVALID` (audited `auth.password_reset_code_failed`); the fifth wrong code burns the token (400 `TOKEN_INVALID`). A recovery code used here sends `security.two_factor` (`recovery_used`). API keys are not revoked |

`GET /api/about` gains `passwordReset: boolean` (email is on, so the forgot page can mail a link; an instance fact, never per account).

`GET /api/about` also carries `twoFactor: boolean` (v0.13.0 QA, A7): whether a TOTP key is configured, so two-factor can be set up on this instance. Only the flag, never the key. With `false`, Settings → Security explains that two-factor is not available instead of offering the setup form (which would end in 503).

Tokens: 32 random bytes, base64url, stored as a SHA-256, minted by the dispatcher at send time (the outbox row holds `{}`), 30 minutes, single use; minting deletes the account's older unused reset tokens. Pages: `/forgot-password` (signed out; its own history entry from the sign-in card) and `/reset-password#token=…` (the fragment is stripped on load; `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on every response).

### Recognised devices, New sign-in and Welcome mail (migration 044)

Plan: the outbound email plan's "later" items #9 and #14, as built ([research/2026-09-28-outbound-email.md](research/2026-09-28-outbound-email.md) §A.3 and its as-built note; T327–T331). Code: `server/signInDevices.ts`, `server/deviceLabels.ts`, `server/mail/signInMail.ts`.

| Method and path | Auth | Body | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/auth/devices` | session (every role) | — | `{ devices: [{ id, label, browser, os, firstSeenAt, lastSeenAt, current }], max: 20 }`, most recently seen first. `label` is built from the fixed browser and OS families ("Firefox on Linux", "Firefox", "Browser on Linux", "Unknown device"); `current` is true for the row matching this request's `mynotes_device` cookie. No hash, cookie, User-Agent, or address is returned |
| `DELETE /api/auth/devices/:id` | session, CSRF, Origin, JSON body `{}` (viewers and guests too: write-gate allowlist) | `{}` | `{ ok: true }`; 404 `{ error: "Device not found" }` for an unknown id, another account's device, or a malformed id. Audited `auth.device_forgotten`. Sessions are untouched |
| `DELETE /api/auth/devices` | same | `{}` | `{ ok: true, forgotten }` (how many rows went). Audited `auth.devices_forgotten` when any did. Sessions are untouched |

Sign-in side effects. Every successful sign-in (`POST /api/auth/login`, `POST /api/auth/register`, the Google callback, `POST /api/auth/google/second-factor`) sets, after the session cookie, `mynotes_device=<43 base64url chars>; Max-Age=34560000; Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax` (plus `Secure` on https). A valid cookie is kept, a missing or malformed one replaced. When the account has no `sign_in_devices` row for SHA-256(`device:<user id>:<cookie>`), a row is added (the 20 most recently seen are kept), an access notice `new_sign_in` is written (bell line "New sign-in from <label>", link `/settings/security`), and security mail `security.new_sign_in` is queued, except for the sign-in that creates the account (registration, invite acceptance, or a Google sign-up). The mail goes only to verified addresses, coalesces per account (`security.new_sign_in:<user id>`) while queued, and waits until 10 minutes after the previous one was sent. Any authenticated request moves the device's `last_seen_at` at most hourly; a session from before 044 (`sessions.legacy_device = 1`) adds its browser without notice or mail on its first request (setting the cookie then, or adding its own row for a cookie another account set), and an account from before 044 (`users.device_baseline = 1`) with no device rows records the browser of its next sign-in without notice or mail; either clears the account's flag. Last seen is read first and written at most hourly.

Welcome mail (`account.welcome`, account class). Accounts created by `createAccount` (registration, invites, Google sign-up) start with `users.welcome_mail = 'pending'`; every other account has NULL and never gets it. The first sign-in queues it with `not_before` = now + 60 s (`queued`) when email is on and the address verified; `waiting` when unverified (verifying within 7 days of registration, by link or by linking Google, queues it then); `skipped` when email is off or the wait ran out.

### Google sign-in (Wave 35)

Plan: [WAVE_35_GOOGLE_SIGNIN.md](WAVE_35_GOOGLE_SIGNIN.md) (D289–D300, T250–T262). Migration **034** (`google_identities`, `google_auth_flows`, `users.avatar_id`, `sessions.reauth_at`). Code: `server/google/`, `server/avatars.ts`, `server/accounts.ts`, `server/passwords.ts`.

**Methods (`AUTH_METHODS`, D295).** With `google`, `POST /api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/password-reset/request`, `/check`, `/complete`, and `/api/auth/password/change` answer **403** `{ error, code: "PASSWORD_SIGNIN_DISABLED" }`, and a password given for re-authentication is refused. With `password`, every route below answers **404** `{ error: "Not found", code: "GOOGLE_SIGNIN_DISABLED" }`. `GET /api/about` gains `authMethods: { password: boolean, google: boolean }` (instance facts), and `passwordReset` is false while `AUTH_METHODS=google`.

| Method and path | Auth | Body or query | Result |

With `reset`, first, in one transaction: sessions, push subscriptions, API keys, calendar feeds, reset links, password, two-factor, unsubscribe epoch, and every owned folder, note, file, board, task view, collection, and calendar back to private with its direct shares, member rows, and group grants deleted; live invites revoked; routines paused. Counts: `{sessions, keys, feeds, items, shares, groupGrants, invites, routines, password, twoFactor}`. `access_events` `account.google_allowed` / `account.google_reset`, `security.account` mail (`google_allowed` or `google_reset` with counts). On a linked account (no reset) it is a re-linking allowance (`relink: true`): the next authoritative Google sign-in with the account's email replaces the identity's `sub` and, in the same transaction, deletes the account's sessions and push subscriptions (and with them `reauth_at`), revokes its API keys and calendar feeds, deletes unused reset links, and bumps the unsubscribe epoch; with `removeCredentials` (default `true`; stored as `users.google_relink_remove_credentials`) it also removes the password and two-factor. Content and sharing stay. `relinkPreview` counts what that removes; the completed re-link records `access_events` `account.google_relinked` with the counts and queues `security.password_changed` (`google_linked`). Bell notices (`access_notices`, ids and counts only): `google_allowed`, `google_relink_allowed`, `google_reset` (what went, as bits), `google_unlinked` (admin unlink), and `google_relinked` (completed, as bits). 401 `REAUTH_FAILED`, 428 `TOTP_REQUIRED` (the admin's), 403 `SELF_ACTION`, 409 `RESET_VERIFIED` (web reset of a verified account), 403 `RESET_ADMIN` (web reset of an admin, or of an account whose role changed away from admin in the last 24 hours), 409 `ALREADY_LINKED` (a reset on a linked account). Refusals are checked before the re-authentication. The reset and the allowance commit together; the member gets `notices.googleReset` on `GET /api/auth/me` until `POST /api/auth/notices/google-reset/dismiss` |
| `DELETE /api/team/:userId/google` | admin, CSRF; the acting admin re-authenticates | `{ password?, totpCode? \| recoveryCode? }` | `{ ok: true, sessionsEnded }`: removes the member's Google identity and avatar and ends every session and push subscription of the member (QA G3; the host CLI's `unlink-google` does the same); `access_events` `account.google_unlinked`, `security.account` mail (`google_unlinked`). 409 `NO_OTHER_SIGN_IN` unless the member has a usable password (password method on) or a live allowance; 403 `SELF_ACTION`; 404 `NOT_LINKED` |

**Re-authentication (D297, revised).** Only for accounts whose re-authentication method is Google (no usable password, or `AUTH_METHODS=google`): `POST /api/keys`, `POST /api/keys/:id/rotate`, `POST /api/mcp/keys`, `POST /api/auth/totp/setup`, `POST /api/auth/totp/recovery-codes`, `POST /api/auth/totp/recovery-codes/regenerate`, and `DELETE /api/auth/totp` accept a body **without** `password` when this session confirmed the account with Google in the last 5 minutes (`reauth_at`); TOTP codes are still required as before. A password, when given, is checked only while the password method is on.

**Accounts.** Google-created accounts store the unusable password sentinel (`!unusable:google`, D294): no password verifies against it, and `Bun.password.verify` is never called on it. An existing account is linked by email only when its address is verified and Google is authoritative for it (a `gmail.com`/`googlemail.com` address without `hd`, or `hd` equal to the domain), or when an admin allowance is live; otherwise `link_required` and nothing changes (T254). Every link (sign-in, Settings, allowance) marks the address verified, audits `auth.google_linked` with `via`, and queues `security.password_changed` with `event: "google_linked"`. The identity's `email` follows Google at each sign-in; `users.email` never does. Every sign-in through Google audits `auth.login` or `auth.register` with `{ via: "google" }`.

**Sign-in limits (final round, S7).** 429 answers, per minute and in memory; a client address is canonical and an IPv6 client counts by its /64 (`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` picks it). `POST /api/auth/login` and the Google second factor: 20 per client address, then 10 per email, then 120 instance-wide. `POST /api/auth/register` and account creation through Google: 5 per client address, then 20 instance-wide (refused registrations count). `POST /api/auth/invite` and `POST /api/auth/google/invite`: 10 per client address, then 60 instance-wide. An attempt refused by a per-client or per-email bucket does not count toward the instance-wide one; a full instance-wide bucket refuses at once.

**Comment pictures (Q3).** `POST /api/tasks/cards/:c/comments` and `PATCH /api/tasks/comments/:id` return the comment with `author_avatar_url`, as the card and comment lists do.

**Access activity.** `GET /api/team/activity?action=accounts` lists the Google actions (`account.google_allowed`, `account.google_reset`, `account.google_unlinked`, `account.google_relinked`).

**Host CLI.** `bun server/team-admin.ts allow-google-link <email> [--reset]` and `bun server/team-admin.ts unlink-google <email>` do what the Team routes do (`via: "cli"`, no actor), in every `AUTH_METHODS` mode, including for an admin's own account.

**`avatarUrl`.** `user` on `me`, sign-in, register, and the Google second factor; Team list and member rows; `GET /api/users` (the share picker); the Access sheet's `people[]`: `avatarUrl: string \| null` (the same-origin route above). Task payloads use `avatar_url`: the board payload's `users` map, and each assignee of `POST /api/tasks/query` and `GET /api/tasks/views/:viewId/cards`. MCP tool output is unchanged.

### Admin endpoints (Team)

Registered before `/api/team/:userId`. Guests get 404, members and viewers 403 `ADMIN_ONLY`.

| Method and path | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/team/mail-log?status=all\|sent\|held\|failed\|dead\|skipped&cursor=` | `{ emailEnabled, today: { sent, held, failed, dead, limit }, entries: [{ id, template, class, status, skipReason, attempts, errorCode, providerId, createdAt, sentAt, notBefore, to: { userId, displayName } \| { hash }, suppression: "bounce" \| "complaint" \| "manual" \| "soft" \| null }], nextCursor }`, 50 a page, newest first. `suppression` is the recipient account's address state now (Wave 29); `errorCode` may be `bounced`, `soft_bounce`, `complained`, `provider_suppressed`, or `provider_failed` after a webhook; `skipReason` adds `muted` and `soft_bounce`. Never an address, subject, or payload |
| `POST /api/team/mail-log/:id/retry` `{}` | `{ ok: true }` requeues a `dead` row for one more attempt; 409 `NOT_RETRYABLE` otherwise (invites are never queued) |

### Mail links and headers

- Every link is `APP_ORIGIN` plus a path from `server/mail/links.ts` (ids checked against the router's pattern; no query except the unsubscribe token; no redirect parameters): `/tasks/:b/card/:c`, `/tasks/:b`, `/tasks/:b/sprints`, `/tasks/my`, `/tasks/views/:v`, `/notes/:n`, `/notes/folder/:f`, `/notes/shared`, `/files/:d`, `/files/shared`, `/collections/:c`, `/calendar`, `/calendar/event/:e`, `/notifications`, `/bin`, `/inbox`, `/team/:u`, `/settings/:section`, `/`.
- Credential links keep their token in the fragment: `/register#invite=…`, `/verify-email#token=…`, `/reset-password#token=…`. The SPA reads it once, strips it, and POSTs it.
- Activity, reminders, and digest mail: a footer link `/mail/unsubscribe#t=<token>` (the page asks before it POSTs; the digest's token turns the digest off), and the headers `List-Unsubscribe: <APP_ORIGIN/api/mail/unsubscribe?t=<token>>` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`. Security and account mail carry neither.
- `/settings/:section` (`security`, `modules`, `keys`, `notifications`, `about`) opens the Settings dialog at that section as a history entry of its own: Back closes it, Forward reopens it; a deep link opens it over Home. The old `/settings/mcp` (before v0.14) opens API keys too and is rewritten to `/settings/keys` with `replaceState` (no extra entry); mails link `/settings/keys`. `/team/email` is the admin Email log.

### Templates (outbox `template`)

| Template | Class / category | Trigger | Grouping |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `team.invite` | account | Admin sends an invite (sent at once, logged in the outbox) | — |
| `account.verify` | account | Registration without an email-bound invite; Settings → Send verification email | — |
| `account.test` | account | Settings → Send me a test email | — |
| `account.password_reset` | account | `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request` for a verified, unblocked account (Wave 30); the token is minted at send time | Merged while queued |
| `security.password_changed` | security | Password changed in Settings or reset from a link (Wave 30); links to Settings → Security and Settings → API keys | — |
| `tasks.assigned` | activity / assignments | Someone else adds you to a card's assignees (web or MCP) | 10 min per recipient |
| `tasks.comment` | activity / comments | A comment on a card you created or are assigned to, by someone else | 10 min per recipient and card |
| `sharing.shared` | activity / sharing | You are added by name to a note, folder, file, board, calendar, collection, or task view (never `all_users`) | 10 min per recipient |
| `inbox.proposals` | activity / proposals | New pending proposals from your keys | 60 min, at most one per 3 h; skipped when none are pending at send time |
| `security.api_key_created` | security | `POST /api/mcp/keys` | — |
| `security.role_changed` | security | A role change | 10 min; a change back to the original role sends nothing |
| `security.two_factor` | security | Two-factor on, off, reset by the host CLI, recovery codes regenerated, a recovery code used | — |
| `security.account` | security | Blocked, unblocked, signed out everywhere (never the admin's reason) | — |
| `calendar.reminder` | reminders / reminders | A reminder with channel `email` or `push_email` fires (queued in the reminders dispatcher's transaction). Never held by quiet hours (D242); "(late)" after 15 min | — (one per fire) |
| `calendar.event_changed` | reminders / reminders | Someone else changes the time or place of, or bins, an event you have a reminder on, with an occurrence in the next 7 days (D238); not for a muted calendar | 10 min per recipient and event; a change undone within it sends nothing |
| `tasks.sprint` | activity / sprints (off by default) | A sprint starts or is completed; board readers with cards assigned in it (D235), never the actor; not for a muted board | 10 min per recipient and sprint (the later event wins) |
| `bin.expiring` | activity / bin (off by default) | Hourly scan: items in your Bin purged within 3 days | At most one per 7 days |
| `digest.summary` | digest | `next_digest_at` reached (daily, or Mondays, at your local time); content read at send time: your own overdue and due-soon cards, events in the next 7 days, proposals (key names and counts), new shares since the last digest | One per period; skipped when empty (D241) |

### Reminder channels (Wave 29)

`POST /api/reminders` accepts `channels: "push" | "email" | "push_email"` (default `push`) on both the event and standalone forms; 409 `EMAIL_OFF` when email is not configured, 409 `EMAIL_UNVERIFIED` when the caller's address is not verified. `ReminderSummary` gains `channels`. An `email` reminder still writes the bell notification but skips Web Push. MCP reminder tools keep `push` (D255: email is an account setting, session-only).

## Nook keys, policies, and the key inventory (Wave 31, Access A)

Plan: `docs/plan/research/2026-09-28-access-management-api-keys.md` (D261–D288, T200–T218). Migration **025** (`access_keys`) adds every access table Waves 32–34 need; Wave 31 uses the key columns, `api_key_grants`, `api_key_usage`, `team_settings`, and `access_events`.

**Rights check (D263).** On every `/mcp` request and every tool call a key's effective rights are recomputed: **grants ∩ the owner's current role scopes (`mcpScopesForRole`) ∩ org policy (modules per role)**. A key is refused outright when revoked, past its rotation grace, expired (`401`, `This API key has expired`), when its owner is blocked, or when policy blocks it (`403 {error, code: "KEY_POLICY"}` on `/mcp`; tool result code `KEY_POLICY`). A write grant the role cannot use still reads (a demoted member keeps reads, T81). The owner's access to each item is still checked by the module service, as for sessions. Keys never manage access (D265): no tool or key-authenticated route touches keys, grants, policies, or sharing.

**Scopes as a compatibility view.** Each grant `{module, permission}` is one MCP scope (`server/keyGrants.ts` `SCOPE_GRANTS`: `notes:read` = notes/read, `notes:write-draft` = notes/draft, `notes:publish` = notes/publish, `files:write` = files/write, `bin:write` = bin/write, …). Tool registration keeps using scopes; `mcp_api_keys.scopes` is still written as a mirror for one release.

**Chosen items (D281; as built in Wave 31, widened in Wave 34: see "Resource-scoped keys and REST v1" below).** Grants for `tasks`, `collections`, and `calendar` may name boards, collections, or calendars (`resourceIds`). Such a key sees only tools that declare their resource (`McpToolSpec.resource`: `list_cards`, `get_card`, `create_card`, `update_card`, `move_card`, `comment_on_card`, `bin_card`/`restore_card`, `manage_tags`, `set_wip_limit`, `create_sprint`, `start_sprint`, `list_sprints`, `list_children`; `query_rows`, `get_row`, `create_row`, `update_row`, `bin_row`/`restore_row`; `get_event`, `create_event`, `update_event`, `create_reminder`, `bin_event`/`restore_event`) and the list tools with `listFilter` (`list_boards`, `list_collections`, `list_calendars`, filtered to the chosen items). Each call must name an item inside a chosen container (a card's board, a row's collection, an event's calendar); anything else is `NOT_FOUND`, exactly like a missing item. Every other tool (search across boards, `link_cards`, `link_attachment`, `list_events`, Today, inbox proposals) is hidden from such a key, and handlers only see the scopes the key holds over whole modules, until Wave 34 adds per-tool resource filters. Foreign items a visible tool presents (relations, event links, note fields) are checked against the grants as well and come back restricted when outside them (see "Foreign items and key grants" under the MCP tools).

Audited `mcp.key_created`; `access_events` `key.created` | Checked **before** the password, so no code is consumed: 400 (shape, `INVALID_GRANT`), 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` (guests), 403 `SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED` (role), 403 `KEY_POLICY` (surface, lifetime over the maximum, `expiresInDays: null` while `key_require_expiry` is on with `requireExpiry: true`, module off for the role), 404 `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` (a chosen item missing or not reachable at that level, T205), 409 `KEY_LIMIT`, 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (20 creations and rotations an hour); then 401 `REAUTH_FAILED` |
| `PATCH /api/keys/:id` | `{ name?, description?, surfaces?, expiresInDays?: 1..365 \| null, grants?, limits? }` (null only keeps a key that has no expiry) | 200 `{ changed: string[], key }`: narrowing only, no password (D278). `access_events` `key.narrowed` | 400 `WIDENING_NOT_ALLOWED` (a grant not covered by a current one, "chosen" to "all", a later expiry or `null` on a dated key, `mcp`→`both`, a higher or cleared limit), 404 |
| `POST /api/keys/:id/rotate` | `{ graceHours: 0 \| 1 \| 24 \| 168 = 24, expiresInDays?: 1..365 \| null, password, totpCode? \| recoveryCode? }` | 201 `{ key: ApiKey & { token }, oldKey }`: a new key with the same name, grants, surfaces, and limits (`rotatedFrom`); its lifetime is `expiresInDays` when given (null = no expiry, C2), else equal to the old one's (policy default for keys without expiry) capped by policy. The old key keeps working until `revokeAfter`; routines bound to it move to the new key in the same transaction. An expired key may be rotated (with the password): that is how it is renewed. `access_events` `key.rotated` + `key.created` | Checked **before** the password, as for creation: 404, 409 `KEY_ROTATING` (already in grace), 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` (the holder is now a guest), 403 `SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED` (a grant the holder's role can no longer hold), 403 `KEY_POLICY` (the key's surface or one of its modules is off for the role, a chosen lifetime over the maximum, or `null` while `key_require_expiry` is on), 409 `KEY_LIMIT` (the old key still counts during a grace; a 0-hour rotation needs no free slot); then 429, 401 |
| `DELETE /api/keys/:id` | `{}` | 200 `{ ok: true }`: revoked now (also ends a grace early); pending proposals are withdrawn | 404 |
| `GET /api/keys/:id/binned`, `POST /api/keys/:id/restore-binned` | as the Wave 19 routes | | |
| `GET/POST /api/mcp/keys`, `DELETE /api/mcp/keys/:id` (and `…/binned`, `…/restore-binned`) | as before | **Alias for one release.** Creates a `general`, `mcp`-surface key with one "all" grant per scope (write scopes add their read), expiring after the policy default, under the same policy and count checks (`KEY_POLICY`, `KEY_LIMIT`) | |
| `GET /api/team/policies` | | 200 `{ policies, defaults, revision, updatedAt, updatedBy, impact }` | 403 `ADMIN_ONLY`, 404 (guests) |
| `POST /api/team/policies/preview` | `{ policies }` | 200 `{ impact: { liveKeys, blocked, newlyBlocked, narrowed } }`: what saving would block (never revokes). Live keys are the usable ones (not revoked, expired, or past a rotation grace; holder not blocked). Each key is checked on its own surfaces: `mcpRoles` for `mcp`, `restRoles` for `rest`, both for `both`; a `both` key is `blocked` only when both surfaces are, and `narrowed` when one is (or when it loses a module). The key list's `blocked` state uses the same rule | 400, 403, 404 |
| `PUT /api/team/policies` | `{ policies, revision }` | 200 state plus `changed` (setting names). `access_events` `policy.changed` (names only); audit `team.policies_changed` | 400, 403, 404, 409 `POLICIES_CHANGED` (revision), 429 (Team write limit) |
| `GET /api/team/keys?owner&module&state&cursor` | | 200 `{ keys: (ApiKey & { owner: { id, displayName, role, blocked } })[], nextCursor, summary: { live, noExpiry } }`: every unrevoked key, 200 a page; `state` ∈ active, expiring (14 days), no_expiry, blocked, grace, expired, unused (90 days), applied in SQL before the page cut, so every page but the last is full and `nextCursor` is null only at the end. Resource names are always `null` (T204); no token material (T215) | 400, 403, 404 |
| `POST /api/team/keys/:id/revoke` | `{ reason: 1–200 }` | 200 `{ ok, keyId, ownerId, revokedAt }`: stops the key at once, withdraws its pending proposals; the owner's list shows `revokedBy: "admin"` and the reason. `access_events` `key.revoked` `{by: "admin", reasonLength}`; audit `team.key_revoked` | 400, 403, 404 |
| `POST /api/team/keys/revoke` | `{ keyIds: uuid[1..50], reason }` | 200 `{ revoked, keyIds }` | 400, 403, 404 |

**Policy at call time (T209).** `key_require_expiry` blocks keys with no expiry (keys made before 025); `key_max_days` blocks keys whose lifetime (`expires_at − created_at`) exceeds it; `mcp_roles` blocks MCP keys of other roles; `key_modules_by_role` makes grants in other modules inactive (the key is not blocked). A blocked key is listed as `blocked` and comes back when the policy is loosened. The first block per key per day is recorded as `key.policy_blocked`.

**Write gate.** `POST /api/keys`, `PATCH /api/keys/:id`, `POST /api/keys/:id/rotate`, and `DELETE /api/keys/:id` are allowlisted for viewers and guests; the handlers cap grants by role (viewers read only, guests none). `/api/team/*` stays self-gated.

**Usage (D283).** Tool calls, writes, and refusals are counted per key per day in memory and flushed to `api_key_usage` every minute (and before any listing); the sweeper trims rows older than 90 days and turns ended rotation graces into revocations (`key.grace_ended`).

## Groups, levels, and item access (Wave 32, Access B)

Plan: `docs/plan/research/2026-09-28-access-management-api-keys.md` §C.5, §C.7, §C.9, §D.2–§D.3 (D266–D275). 025 created `user_groups`, `group_members`, `group_grants`, the per-person `level` columns, `boards.share_role`, and `team_settings`. Migration **029** (`access_levels`) only brings collection and calendar member rows written by v0.12.0 (level `view` under an `editor` audience role) up to `edit`, so nobody loses editing when levels start to count.

**Levels (D266, §D.3).** `view < comment < edit < manage < owner`, allow-only: a person's level on an item is the highest of their direct share, their groups' grants, and the `all_users` audience level, **capped by the Team role** (viewers and guests read at most; owners stay `owner`). Group grants count only under `selected`. Levels are resolved live on every request (`itemLevel()` in `server/access/effective.ts`).

| Kind | Levels offered | Audience level (`all_users`) | Default for new people |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| note, folder | view, edit | view | view |
| document (Files) | view | view | view |
| board | view, comment, edit, manage | `boards.share_role`: view, comment, edit (default edit) | edit (D38) |
| task_view | view | view | view |
| collection, calendar | view, edit, manage | `share_role` viewer/editor | the item's `share_role` |

What each level does: **view** reads; **comment** (boards) also comments and reacts; **edit** changes content (cards and board tags, rows, events; a note's draft and publishing, D274); **manage** (boards, collections, calendars, D273) also changes structure (board name, structure, columns, WIP limits, tag rename and delete, sprints; collection name, icon, fields, and saved views; calendar name and colour) and shares up to `edit`. Deleting, the Bin, and the older audience-wide `/sharing` routes stay the owner's. Refusals: 403 `READ_ONLY` (below `edit`/`comment`), 403 `MANAGER_REQUIRED` (structure without `manage`; MCP reports `OWNER_ONLY`), 403 `OWNER_ONLY` (owner-only actions), 404 for no access.

**Keys never manage (D265, T145).** `manage` is never a key permission, so structure through an API key keeps the pre-Wave-32 rule: only when the key's owner is the item's owner. A manager's key gets `OWNER_ONLY` from `manage_tags` rename and recolour, `set_wip_limit`, `create_sprint`, and `start_sprint`; the manager's web session is unaffected. Collections and calendars have no structure tools, so a manager's key there writes content like an editor's. Creating a board tag needs `edit` (it was any reader before Wave 32). Collection CSV import stays at `edit` although D273 lists import under managers: it writes rows, not structure.

**Responses gain levels.** `BoardSummary` gains `share_role` and `level`; collection and calendar summaries gain `level` next to the old `role` word (`owner`, `editor` for edit or manage, `viewer`); `GET /api/notes/:id` gains `level`, `canEdit`, and `owner_name`.

**Note editors (D274).** Someone at `edit` on the note (or on its immediate folder when the note inherits) opens the shared draft, `PUT /api/notes/:id/draft` with the same `revision` CAS as the owner, and `POST /api/notes/:id/publish` (the version's `author_id` is the editor). Sharing, moving, discarding the draft, restoring versions, and deleting stay owner-only (404 to editors). MCP note tools stay owner-only.

### Groups

| Endpoint | Who | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/groups` | members and admins (the share picker) | | 200 `{ groups: [{ id, name, memberCount, guestCount }], shareWithGuests }`, names and counts only | 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY` (viewers, guests) |
| `GET /api/team/groups` | admin | | 200 `{ groups: GroupSummary[], limit: 200 }` | 403 `ADMIN_ONLY`, 404 (guests) |
| `POST /api/team/groups` | admin | `{ name 1–60, description? ≤ 200 }` | 201 `{ group: GroupDetail }` | 400, 409 `NAME_TAKEN` (case-insensitive), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (200 groups), 429 |
| `GET /api/team/groups/:groupId` | admin | | 200 `{ group: GroupDetail }` | 404 |
| `PATCH /api/team/groups/:groupId` | admin | `{ name?, description?, revision }` | 200 `{ group }` | 400, 404, 409 `GROUP_CHANGED` (CAS), 409 `NAME_TAKEN` |
| `DELETE /api/team/groups/:groupId` | admin | `{ revision? }` | 200 `{ ok, removedGrants, removedMembers }`: its grants and memberships go with it | 404, 409 `GROUP_CHANGED` |
| `PUT /api/team/groups/:groupId/members` | admin | `{ userIds: uuid[] ≤ 500, revision }` | 200 `{ added, removed, selfAdded, group }` | 400 `INVALID_MEMBERS` (unknown or blocked accounts), 400 `GUEST_SHARE_DISABLED` (policy `share_with_guests` off, the group has at least one grant, and the change adds a guest; T213), 404, 409 `GROUP_CHANGED` |

```ts
type GroupSummary = { id; name; description: string | null; memberCount; guestCount; grantCount; revision; createdAt; updatedAt };
type GroupDetail = GroupSummary & {
  members: { id; displayName; role; status: "active" | "blocked"; addedAt; addedBy: { id; displayName } | null; selfAdded: boolean }[];
  items: { kind: AccessKind; title: string; titleHidden: boolean; owner: { id; displayName }; id?: string; level }[];  // ≤ 200; title and id only when the admin can open the item (D269)
  truncated: boolean;
  history: { id; action; createdAt; actor; target; self: boolean }[];                                                  // newest 50 access_events
  guestAddRefused: boolean;                                                                                            // share_with_guests off and grantCount > 0: guests cannot be added
};
```

An admin adding themselves is allowed (O-A1) and flagged: `selfAdded` on the member, `self: true` on the history row and in `access_events` meta. Every change writes `access_events` (`group.created`, `group.updated`, `group.deleted`, `group.member_added`, `group.member_removed`; ids only) and an audit row. Writes use the Team write limit (30 a minute). Groups are admin-only: the `groups_member_create` policy stays stored only (O-A2, off). There are no group-management MCP tools.

**Guests and the policy (T213).** With `share_with_guests` off, `PUT …/members` refuses a change that adds a guest to a group with at least one grant (400 `GUEST_SHARE_DISABLED`, the sharing routes' shape); removals always work, guests already in the group stay, and a group without grants still takes guests (sharing it is then refused). `PUT /api/team/:userId/role` to `guest` is refused the same way while the person is in a group with a grant (remove them from it first). The policy is **not retroactive**: turning it off revokes nothing, so shares with guests made before (direct, or through groups guests were already in, or direct shares of someone later made a guest) stay until their owner or an admin removes them. It is a write-time refusal of what a save **adds**: every sharing route compares the save with the stored rows and refuses only a guest person not shared with before, a group that includes a guest and was not granted before, or a higher level for an existing guest person or guest group. Rows kept unchanged, lowered, or removed always save, so an owner can still add other people next to a group that already reaches a guest.

### Item access (the Access sheet)

`GET` and `PUT` on `/api/notes/:id/access`, `/api/folders/:id/access`, `/api/files/:id/access`, `/api/tasks/boards/:boardId/access`, `/api/tasks/views/:viewId/access`, `/api/collections/:collectionId/access`, `/api/calendars/:calendarId/access`.

```ts
type ItemAccess = {
  etag: string;                       // also the ETag header; a hash of the audience and every grant row
  kind: AccessKind; title: string; owner: { id; displayName };
  audience: "private" | "selected" | "all_users" | "inherit";   // inherit: notes and files only
  audienceLevel?: Level | null; audienceLevels?: Level[];       // boards, collections, calendars
  people: { id; displayName; teamRole: Role; kind: "person" | "service"; level: Level; via: "direct"; blocked: boolean;
            groupIds: string[] }[];   // the listed groups this person is also in: the sheet says "Also Can edit through Ops" when a group gives more
  groups: { id; name; memberCount; guestCount; selfAddedCount; level: Level }[];
  levels: Level[];                    // what the caller may give: managers never see manage
  yourLevel: "owner" | "manage";
  youId: string;                      // the caller: a manager's own row says "Ask the owner to change your access" (MANAGER_CAP)
  shareWithGuests: boolean; inheritable: boolean;
};
type AccessPut = { audience; audienceLevel?: Level; people: { id; level }[] ≤ 100; groups: { id; level }[] ≤ 20 };
```

- **Who.** The owner, and managers on boards, collections, and calendars. Other readers get 403 `OWNER_ONLY`; everyone else, and binned, purged, or non-Files documents, 404 (T204). `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- **PUT** needs `If-Match` with the ETag from GET (quoted or not): 428 `ETAG_REQUIRED` without it, 409 `ACCESS_CHANGED` with `{ access }` (the current state) when it is stale. The direct rows and the group grants are replaced in one transaction and the audience written; people and groups apply only to `selected` (400 otherwise), and `selected` needs at least one of them.
- **400**: `LEVEL_NOT_OFFERED` (a level the kind does not offer, or an audience level outside `audienceLevels`), `INVALID` (`inherit` on a kind without folders, an audience level on a kind without one, the owner as a recipient, unknown or blocked new people, unknown groups, more than 100 people or 20 groups), `GUEST_SHARE_DISABLED` with `guests: { people: string[]; groups: string[] }` (policy `share_with_guests` off and the save newly adds a guest, newly adds a group that includes one, or raises the level of an existing guest person or guest group; the ids name those rows. Unchanged, lowered, and removed rows never count, D.2, T213).
- **Managers (D273, T207)**: 403 `MANAGER_CAP` for any change to the audience or its level, or to the set of `manage` rows (they cannot grant, change, or remove a manager, themselves included).
- **Mail and audit.** People newly added by name get the "shared with you" mail (groups are not mailed). `access_events` `item.access_changed` and audit `item.access_changed` carry `{ kind, audience, peopleCount, groupCount, asManager? }`, never titles or user ids.

**Older sharing routes.** `GET/PUT …/sharing` keep working: they keep each existing person's level (new people get the module default; the collection and calendar route's one `role` still applies to everyone it names, except managers), leave group grants untouched, and honour `share_with_guests` the same way (only a guest they newly add, or raise through the collection and calendar route's one `role`, is refused; the body is the plain `{ error, code }`). With the policy off, `GET /api/users` leaves guests out. The policy never revokes shares that already reach guests (see Groups above).

**Write gate.** `PUT …/access` is not allowlisted: viewers and guests get 403 `ROLE_READ_ONLY`.

**Your keys (Wave 33).** For the owner only, `ItemAccess` also carries `keysWithAccess`: how many of the owner's usable keys (live, unexpired, not past a rotation grace) hold a grant on the item's module over "all" or on this item. The sheet shows "N of your API keys can reach this". Managers never get the count.

## Central access management (Wave 33, Access C)

Plan: `docs/plan/research/2026-09-28-access-management-api-keys.md` §C.6, §C.7, §C.11 (D267–D269, D286, D288; T204, T214, T218). Migration **032** (`access_central`) adds the bell's `access_notices` table, the invite's template snapshot columns (`team_invites.template_group_ids`, `template_name`, `template_revision`), and an `access_events(actor_id, created_at)` index; everything else uses tables from 025.

### Member access

```ts
type AccessKind = "note" | "folder" | "document" | "board" | "task_view" | "collection" | "calendar";
type ResetCounts = { directShares; groups; keys; feeds; routines };
type AccessSummary = {
  member: { id; displayName; role; status: "active" | "blocked"; isYou };
  groups: { id; name; grantCount; memberCount; addedAt; addedBy: { id; displayName } | null; selfAdded }[];
  keys: { id; name; prefix; state; surfaces; expiresAt; lastUsedAt; modules: string[] }[];   // live keys, metadata only (T215)
  feeds: { live: number }; routines: { enabled: number };
  kinds: { kind: AccessKind; module; items: number; direct: number; groupItems: number; both: number; group: number; audience: number }[];  // items: distinct items (the headline); direct: items shared directly; groupItems: distinct items through groups; both: items reached both ways (direct + groupItems - both = items); group: grant rows; audience: all_users items not owned (0 for guests)
  resetCounts: ResetCounts; pageSize: 200;
};
type AccessRow = {                                         // one row per item
  kind: AccessKind; title: string; titleHidden: boolean;   // "Board owned by Carol" when the viewer cannot open the item (D269)
  owner: { id; displayName }; id?: string;                 // id only when the viewer can open the item
  level: Level;                                            // the best of the sources
  active: boolean;                                         // the person reaches the item now (it may be private, binned, or the person blocked)
  sources: {                                               // every way they reach it: the direct share first, then groups by name
    via: "direct" | "group"; level: Level; group: { id; name } | null;
    lowerTo: Level[];                                      // levels a direct share can be lowered to; [] for group sources and view-only kinds
    handle?: string;                                       // admin page only: opaque, sealed (AES-GCM), bound to the admin and the person, 6 h
  }[];
};
```

| `GET /api/me/access[?kind=&cursor=]` | every role but guest | | the same shapes for yourself, without handles | 404 (guests) |

- **Reductions only (D268).** Nothing here adds a share or raises a level. Remove deletes the person's direct share row; Lower sets a strictly lower level the kind offers; a group row's Remove takes the person out of that group (the group's `revision` moves). **Reset access** removes every direct share and group membership, revokes every live key (reason "Access reset by an admin") and calendar feed, and pauses routines, in one transaction; owned items and `all_users` audiences stay.
- **Audit.** `access_events` `access.share_removed` (meta `{ level }`), `access.share_lowered` (`{ from, to }`), `group.member_removed` (`{ from: "member_access" | "reset" }`), `key.revoked` (`{ by: "admin", reset? }`), and `access.reset` (the removed counts); `audit_log` `team.access_removed`, `team.access_lowered`, `team.access_reset`. Ids and counts only.
- **Bell (§C.11, migration 032).** The item's owner hears about a removal or lowering, and once per Reset with the count of their items; the person hears about a Reset, about group additions and removals, and about an admin revoking their key (Team → Keys too). A lowering names the new level ("… to Can edit", stored as `access_notices.level`); the person's Reset line names only what was removed (a bitmask of shares, groups, keys, feeds, routines in `access_notices.count`). Nobody is told about their own action. `GET /api/notifications` merges these lines (built at read time, so titles show only to someone who can open the item) with calendar and proposal notifications; `POST /api/notifications/read` and the 30-day sweep cover both. No email: the plan defines no mail kind for these yet (O-A13). Each line links to what it is about (v0.32, see Calendar → Deep links).
- **Feed links and routines (v0.32).** The summary's `feeds` and `routines` gain `items`: `feeds.items: { id, detail: "busy" | "full", prefix, createdAt, lastUsedAt, calendar: { title, titleHidden, owner: { displayName } } }[]` (live links, newest first, at most 200; the calendar named only when the viewer can open it, D269, and never its id) and `routines.items: { id, name, enabled, schedule, nextDueAt, lastRunAt, keyName }[]` (enabled first, then by name, at most 200; never instructions, targets, or scope hints). The admin may **revoke one feed** (the link stops at once; `access_events` `access.feed_revoked` with the calendar as the resource and meta `{ by: "admin", detail }`, `audit_log` `team.feed_revoked`) or **pause one routine** (`enabled = 0`, revision bumped; `access.routine_paused`, `team.routine_paused`); both are reductions (D268), need no re-authentication (like the other reductions here and Team → Keys revoke), work on a blocked person, and put a bell notice with the person (`feed_revoked`, `routine_paused`; dropped on your own page). Only the owner resumes a routine. On `/api/me/access` the person uses the owner routes: `DELETE /api/feeds/:feedId` (viewers too: the write gate allows it for them) and `POST /api/inbox/routines/:id/pause|resume` (members and admins).
- **Write limit.** The writes share the Team write limit (30 a minute per admin, T218).

### Templates (D286)

```ts
type AccessTemplate = { id; name; role: "member" | "viewer" | "guest"; groups: { id; name; guestRefused: boolean }[]; liveInvites: number; revision; createdAt; updatedAt };
// guestRefused: with share_with_guests off, a guest cannot join this group (it has grants): an invite skips it, apply-to-member refuses.
```

| Endpoint | Who | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/team/templates` | admin | | 200 `{ templates: AccessTemplate[], limit: 50 }` | 403 `ADMIN_ONLY`, 404 (guests) |
| `POST /api/team/templates` | admin | `{ name 1–60, role, groupIds?: uuid[] ≤ 20 }` | 201 `{ template }` | 400 `INVALID_GROUPS`, 409 `NAME_TAKEN` (case-insensitive), 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` |
| `PATCH /api/team/templates/:templateId` | admin | `{ name?, role?, groupIds?, revision }` | 200 `{ template }` | 400, 404, 409 `TEMPLATE_CHANGED` (CAS), 409 `NAME_TAKEN` |
| `DELETE /api/team/templates/:templateId` | admin | `{ revision? }` | 200 `{ ok, liveInvites }` | 404, 409 `TEMPLATE_CHANGED` |

**On invites.** `POST /api/team/invites` accepts `templateId`; the template's role must equal the invite's (400 `TEMPLATE_ROLE_MISMATCH`, 404 `TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND`). Creating the invite **snapshots** the template: its group ids, name, and revision (`team_invites.template_group_ids`, `template_name`, `template_revision`). `TeamInvite` gains `template: { id, name, groupCount, groupNames: string[], deletedGroupCount, edited, guestSkipped: string[] } | null` (`groupCount`: snapshot groups that still exist, `groupNames` their names in snapshot order; `deletedGroupCount`: those deleted since, which acceptance skips) (`guestSkipped`: for a guest invite, the snapshot groups skipped right now because sharing with guests is off; checked again at acceptance): the snapshot's name and group count, and `edited` when the template has changed since. When the invite is accepted, the registration transaction adds the new account to the **snapshot's** groups that still exist and have room (`added_by` = the admin who created the invite) and records `template.applied` `{ templateId, added, skipped }`. The invite's own role always wins, and editing a template later changes only invites created after the edit; Team → Templates shows how many live invites carry each template. **Guests (T213):** with `share_with_guests` off, a guest never joins a group that has grants through a template either (the same rule as `PUT /api/team/groups/:id/members`, one helper `guestJoinRefused`): on invite acceptance that group is skipped and counted (`template.applied` meta `guestRefused`), and the account is still created; applying a template to someone is refused as a whole with 400 `GUEST_SHARE_DISABLED`. Removing people (remove from a group, Reset access) is never refused. Deleting a template sets `team_invites.template_id` to NULL: the invite still works, with its role and no groups. `access_events`: `template.created`, `template.updated`, `template.deleted`, `template.applied`, each with `templateName` in meta (on acceptance, the snapshot's name).

### Access activity

`GET /api/team/activity?user=&group=&key=&action=&cursor=` (admin; 403 `ADMIN_ONLY`, 404 for guests): `access_events` newest first, 50 a page, `{ events, nextCursor }`; an event's `key` is `{ id, name, prefix, owner: { id, displayName } | null }` (the owner names keys that are no longer live, C15b). `user` matches the actor or the target; `action` is a family: `keys`, `groups`, `items` (`item.*` and `access.*`), `policies`, `templates`.

```ts
type ActivityEvent = {
  id; action; via; createdAt;
  actor: { id; displayName } | null; target: { id; displayName } | null;
  group: { id; name } | null; key: { id; name; prefix } | null;
  item: { kind; title; titleHidden; owner; id? } | null;   // redacted for the viewer as in AccessRow

};
```

**MCP.** None: the plan lists no MCP tool for Access C, and keys never manage access (D265).

## Resource-scoped keys and REST v1 (Wave 34, Access D)

Plan: `docs/plan/research/2026-09-28-access-management-api-keys.md` (D279–D284, O-A7, O-A8, O-A12, T203, T210, T211). Migration **033** (`key_surfaces`) adds `mcp_api_keys.last_used_mcp_at`, `last_used_rest_at`, and the last refusal (`last_denied_at`, `last_denied_reason`, `last_denied_surface`), and the per-surface daily counts `api_key_surface_usage (key_id, day, surface, calls, writes, denied)`; everything else was created by 025.

### Resource policy on every tool (D281)

Every MCP tool declares what it touches (`McpToolSpec.access`, `server/mcpToolKit.ts`), and `runTool` enforces chosen-item keys from the declaration, not in each tool. `tests/toolResourcePolicy.test.ts` fails for a tool without one, for a declared argument the tool does not have, and for an id argument that is neither checked nor explained (`related`).

| Mode | Meaning | Chosen-items key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | The tool acts on the items its arguments name (`{arg, kind}`; arrays name several) | Each named item must lie inside the key's chosen items for the tool's scopes (and for each `alsoRequires` scope); checked on the raw arguments **before** validation. Missing, unreadable, and outside the grant are the same `NOT_FOUND`, and the error never names the item. An optional container argument (a new note's `folderId`) must be given: leaving it out would act in the Default folder (`INVALID`) |
| `list` | The tool lists items (`lists`) | The handler narrows its SQL with the key's reach (`keyFilter`, `keyContainerIds`) **before** any LIMIT, so pages, `truncated`, `more`, and totals count only granted items. Optional narrowing arguments (a list's folder, a query's view) are checked as above when given |
| `derived` | Parts of several modules (`get_today`, `submit_proposals`) | Each part is filtered by its own module's reach: Today sections narrow their SQL; a proposal's target must be inside the kind's module grant (a note draft is checked before it is written) |
| `own` | Only what this key itself made (`finish_upload`, `list_my_proposals`, `withdraw_proposal`) | Allowed |
| `global` | Not item-scoped (team directory, `create_folder`, `create_collection`, `create_whiteboard`) | Hidden and refused (`SCOPE_REQUIRED`) unless the key covers the whole module |

**Anchors.** An item is inside a grant when the grant names the item or its container: a card, column, or sprint by its board; a row by its collection; an event by its calendar; a note or a Files document by itself or its **immediate** folder (folders never cascade, D271); a whiteboard by itself; a routine run by its routine; a saved view by itself. A tool whose declared items the key's chosen kinds can never anchor (a view-only key and `get_card`) is not offered.

**Selectable kinds per module** (`SELECTOR_KINDS`): notes `folder`, `note`; files `folder`, `document`; tasks `board`, `task_view` (read only, and only views the key's holder **owns** (review S2): a view someone else owns would follow their later edits across boards; a grant on one made before this rule is listed `inactiveReason: "unavailable"` and reaches nothing, and rotation or PATCH refuses to keep it with 400 `INVALID_GRANT`); collections `collection`; calendar `calendar`; inbox `routine`; whiteboards `whiteboard`. Today, Team, and the Bin cover every item (Bin tools also need the module grant on the item). Writing grants on folders, notes, and files may name only the holder's own (MCP note and file writes are the owner's).

**Proposals (review S3).** `submit_proposals` checks each proposal's target (`boardId`, `cardId`, `calendarId`, `eventId`, `collectionId`, `rowId`; a note draft's `noteId` or `folderId`) against the key's chosen items **before** any validation that reads the owner's data, so an item outside the grant is `NOT_FOUND` whatever else is wrong with the proposal.

**Cross-module reads** (`server/keyReach.ts` `keyMayRead`): relations, event links, and collection note fields present a target only when the key reaches it by the same anchors; otherwise the existing restricted shape. `query_cards` with a filter runs only over the key's chosen boards, and its `refs` name only those boards and their columns and tags; with `viewId` it runs a view the key was given, as the owner reads it. Routine prompts, `list_routines`, and `list_due_routines` list only chosen routines.

### Key changes

| Endpoint | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/keys` | `grants[].resources?: [{ kind, id }] (1..100)` names chosen items of any kind the module offers (`resourceIds` still names the module's main kind; not both). A view needs `permission: "read"` (400 `INVALID_GRANT`); a kind the module does not offer is 400 `INVALID_GRANT`; a missing or unreachable item is 404 `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`. `ipAllowlist?: string[1..10]` (see below); 400 `IP_ALLOWLIST_UNAVAILABLE` when the server cannot check addresses, 400 `INVALID_IP_ALLOWLIST` for a bad entry. `surfaces` defaults to `"mcp"`; REST is opt-in and needs the role in `rest_roles` (403 `KEY_POLICY`) |
| `PATCH /api/keys/:id` | `ipAllowlist?: string[] \| null`: adding a list, or a list whose every entry lies inside the current one, narrows (no password); `null` or a wider entry is 400 `WIDENING_NOT_ALLOWED`. `surfaces` can go from `both` to `mcp` or `rest`, never wider |
| `POST /api/keys/:id/rotate` | Review Q2: rotation re-authenticates (D278), so it may also change the new key, **widening included**: `grants?` (validated like a new key), `surfaces?`, `ipAllowlist?: string[] \| null` (null removes the limit). Omitted fields keep the old key's values. PATCH stays narrowing-only and its refusals say "Rotate the key to change this." |
| `grants[]` | A create-only permission (`whiteboards:write`) takes no chosen items: 400 `INVALID_GRANT` |
| `GET /api/keys` | Each key adds `lastUsed: { mcp, rest }` (written at most once a minute per surface), `usageBySurface14d: { mcp, rest, daily: { mcp[14], rest[14] } }`, `lastDenied: { at, reason, surface } \| null` (review Q1; reasons `ip`, `surface`, `policy_surface_role`, `policy_expiry_required`, `policy_lifetime`, `expired`, `rotated`, `paused`), `blockedSurfaces` (review Q3: surfaces team policy blocks now), `ipRestricted`, and `ipAllowlist` (the owner's own keys only); `policy.ipAllowlistAvailable`, `policy.ipProxyPinned` (`TRUSTED_PROXY_ADDRESSES` is set). `GET /api/keys/:id` events include `key.denied` `{reason, surface, clientPrefix?}` at most once per reason per hour per key; `clientPrefix` (the /24 or /64, address refusals only) is shown only to the owner, never in Team → Access activity |
| `GET /api/team/keys` | Adds `?surface=mcp\|rest` (a `both` key matches either) and `?ipRestricted=true\|false`; `summary.matching` counts the keys the filters match (review Q14). Keys show `ipRestricted`, never the addresses, plus per-surface last use and daily calls (review Q12); there is no per-call log |

### IP allowlists (D284, O-A7, T211)

A key may list up to 10 IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or CIDR ranges (canonical form, so `203.0.113.5/24` is stored as `203.0.113.0/24`; `/0` is refused because it allows every address). Every request on `/mcp`, `PUT /mcp/uploads/:id`, and `/api/v1` from a limited key is checked against the client address (`server/clientAddress.ts` `clientIp`: the socket address, or with `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS = N ≥ 1` the N-th `X-Forwarded-For` entry from the right; review S1: when `TRUSTED_PROXY_ADDRESSES` is set, the header is read only when the socket peer is one of those proxies, so a direct caller is seen as themselves). Allowlists are **offered and enforced only when `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` is 1 or more**; with 0 they are hidden in the UI and refused by the API, and a key that already holds one is refused (403 `IP_NOT_ALLOWED`, "this server cannot check addresses") rather than let through. A refused call is 403 `{ error: "This API key cannot be used from this address", code: "IP_NOT_ALLOWED" }` and never echoes the list or the address.

### REST v1

Base path `/api/v1`, outside the `/api/*` session, CSRF, TOTP-setup, and role middleware (like `/mcp`).

- **Authentication:** `Authorization: Bearer <key>` only (the scheme in any case, review S7). Cookies are never read. A key in a query string or path is refused before anything else: 400 `KEY_IN_URL` ("revoke this key: it may now be in logs"); parameter names `api_key`, `apikey`, `key`, `token`, `access_token`, `bearer`, `auth`, `authorization`, or any value starting `mynotes_` or `nkv_`. No key or another scheme: 401 `AUTH_REQUIRED`. A key that does not authenticate (unknown, mistyped, expired, past its rotation grace, revoked, or its holder blocked): always 401 `KEY_INVALID` with the same message, so a caller cannot tell which; the reason is recorded only for the key's owner (`lastDenied`, `key.denied`). Both carry `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`; after 60 failures a minute per surface, 429 `RATE_LIMITED`.
- **Surface and policy per request:** the key's `surfaces` must include REST and its owner's role must be in `rest_roles` (default admin, member), else 403 `KEY_POLICY`. Expired, past its rotation grace, revoked, or the owner blocked: 401. Allowlist: 403 `IP_NOT_ALLOWED`.
- **Host and Origin:** the same checks as `/mcp` (403 `HOST_INVALID` for an unknown Host, 403 `ORIGIN_INVALID` for an Origin that is not one of `APP_ORIGINS`). No CORS headers are ever sent; `OPTIONS` answers 405. Responses are JSON with `Cache-Control: no-store, private` and `Vary: Authorization`.
- **Limits:** the MCP limits and per-key lower limits, with the **per-minute buckets kept per surface** (per key and per user) so a REST flood cannot starve MCP: a key used on both surfaces therefore gets each minute's limit on each (`/api/v1/me` says so in `limits.perSurface` and `limits.note`); daily budgets are shared across surfaces. A refused call is counted once, on its surface (review S5). REST has its own 24 concurrent request slots (503 `BUSY` with `Retry-After: 1`). Bodies are bounded like every JSON body (2.1 MB, 413 `TOO_LARGE`).

| Endpoint | Body | Success | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/me` | | 200 `{ key: { id, name, prefix, kind, surfaces, createdAt, expiresAt, rotationEndsAt, ipRestricted }, owner: { id, displayName, role, kind }, grants: [{ module, permission, resource: { kind, id } \| null }] (effective), scopes, limits: { perKey: { callsPerMinute, writesPerMinute }, perUser: {…}, note } }`. Never the token, its hash, or the allowlist. Counts as one call | 401, 403, 429 |
| `GET /api/v1/tools` | | 200 `{ tools: [{ name, title, description, write, annotations, inputSchema }] }`: exactly the tools MCP `tools/list` offers this key now, with JSON Schema inputs. Counts as one call | 401, 403, 429 |
| `POST /api/v1/tools/:name` | a JSON object with the tool's arguments (`{}` for none); `Content-Type: application/json` | 200 with the tool's JSON result (the same object MCP returns as text) | 415 `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE`, 400 `INVALID_JSON` (not a JSON object), 404 `NOT_FOUND` (no such tool, or a tool this key cannot see: the two look the same), and the tool's own `{ error, code, … }` with the status below |

Invalid arguments are 400 `INVALID` with `details` naming each argument (`"cardId: Invalid UUID"`, review Q4), on both surfaces. A `KEY_POLICY` refusal says which surface is blocked and, for a key on both, that the other still works (review Q3). `KEY_IN_URL` fires for any credential-like parameter and says to revoke the key only if it was a real one.

**All REST codes:** `AUTH_REQUIRED` 401, `KEY_INVALID` 401, `RATE_LIMITED` 429, `HOST_INVALID` 403, `ORIGIN_INVALID` 403, `KEY_POLICY` 403, `IP_NOT_ALLOWED` 403, `KEY_IN_URL` 400, `NOT_FOUND` 404, `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` 405, `UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE` 415, `INVALID_JSON` 400, `TOO_LARGE` 413, `BUSY` 503, and the tool codes below. `PUT /mcp/uploads/:id` adds `CONTENT_TYPE` 400, `LENGTH_REQUIRED` 411, `SIZE_MISMATCH` 400, and `UPLOAD_*`; it authenticates the key on the surface `begin_upload` was called on (review S4) and audits a REST ticket's upload as `via: "rest"`.

Tool error codes to statuses: `INVALID` 400; `SCOPE_REQUIRED`, `READ_ONLY`, `KEY_POLICY`, `OWNER_ONLY`, `KIND_NOT_ALLOWED`, `TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED` 403; `NOT_FOUND` 404; `UPLOAD_EXPIRED` 410; `TOO_LARGE` 413; `NOT_TEXT`, `HASH_MISMATCH` 422; `*_CHANGED`, `DRAFT_NOT_SEEN`, `NO_DRAFT`, `NO_CHANGES`, `STALE_POSITION`, `LIMIT_REACHED`, `COLUMN_FULL`, `RELATION_EXISTS`, `REMINDER_EXISTS`, `PURGING`, `PARENT_IN_BIN`, `AUDIENCE_CHANGE`, `NAME_TAKEN`, `SPRINT_ACTIVE`, `UPLOAD_PENDING`, `QUOTA_EXCEEDED`, `RUN_ACTIVE` 409; `RATE_LIMITED` 429 with `Retry-After`; `INTERNAL` 500; anything else 400.

**Parity.** A REST call runs the same `McpToolSpec` through the same `runTool` with `surface: "rest"`: the same validation, grants and chosen items, role checks, limits, output bounds, and untrusted-content wording in descriptions and fields. Writes are audited with `via: "rest"` (merged after the modules' `via: "mcp"`, `server/db.ts` `withSurfaceAuditContext`). Usage is counted per surface. A `begin_upload` ticket from a REST key is finished with `PUT /mcp/uploads/:id` using the same key (the upload endpoint accepts the key on whichever surface it holds). No resource-style routes in v1 (O-A12). `tests/restV1.test.ts` runs every tool through both surfaces.

Example (placeholders):

```sh
curl -s https://nook.example.com/api/v1/me -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
curl -s -X POST https://nook.example.com/api/v1/tools/create_card \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"boardId":"<BOARD_ID>","columnId":"<COLUMN_ID>","title":"Deploy finished"}'
```

`owner.kind` is `"person"`, or `"service"` for an integration's key (Wave 36).

## Integrations (service accounts, Wave 36)

D287, O-A11, T212. An integration is a `users` row with `kind = 'service'`: an account for an AI client or script that **never signs in** and acts only through its keys. Migration **036** (`service_accounts`) adds `users.description` (≤ 200), `users.retired_at` (a deleted integration kept for attribution: only an integration, only a blocked one), and triggers that refuse, in the database, a session row or a Google identity for an integration (inserted or moved onto it), a role other than `member` or `viewer`, any change of `kind`, and clearing `retired_at` or lifting a retired integration's block.

- **Identity:** `email` is `svc-<id>@service.invalid` (the reserved `.invalid` domain, RFC 2606): `isEmailAllowed` refuses every `.invalid` address whatever `ALLOWED_EMAILS` says, so registration, password sign-in, password reset, invites, and Google sign-in or linking can never reach it. `password_hash` is the unusable `!unusable:service`. No TOTP, no Google identity, no picture (`avatarUrl` is always null).
- **Sign-in paths that refuse it:** `POST /api/auth/login` (the lookup is people only), `POST /api/auth/register` (reserved address), `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request|check|complete` (people only), invites bound to its address (`EMAIL_NOT_ALLOWED`), Google callback, second factor, link, and re-authentication (`kind = 'person'` lookups; the address is refused first), `createSession` (throws), `requireAuth` and `readSession` (`u.kind = 'person'`), `verifyReauth` (people only), and the admin Google routes `/api/team/:userId/google…` (404).
- **Keys:** `mcp_api_keys.user_id` is the integration; `created_by` is the admin who created or rotated it. The key's rights are its grants ∩ the **integration's** role ∩ policy ∩ what owners shared with the integration. Key authentication does not apply `ALLOWED_EMAILS` to an integration (its address is never on it); blocking the integration pauses its keys. Integration keys never hold `inbox` or `team` grants (403 `KEY_POLICY`).
- **Reach:** only what an owner shares with it **by name** (the Access sheet, like a person). It is never part of an `all_users` ("everyone signed in") audience (`audienceAllUsersFor` and the level resolvers require `kind = 'person'`), and it cannot join a group (`PUT /api/team/groups/:id/members` → 400 `INTEGRATION_NOT_ALLOWED`; templates never apply to it).
- **Notices:** no email (`enqueueMail` and the dispatcher skip it), no bell (`notifyAccess`, proposal and routine notices skip it; its reminders advance without a notice).
- **Directory:** `GET /api/users` adds every active integration after the (capped) people, each with `kind: "service"` (blocked and retired ones are left out). The Tasks assignee picker (`GET /api/tasks/boards/:b/readers`) marks one with `isIntegration: true`, and a card's `assignees[]` in web answers with `is_integration: true`. The Access sheet's `people[].kind` is `"service"` for it. `GET /api/team` lists people only. `GET /api/team/keys` rows carry `owner.kind`, and Team → Keys marks an integration owner with the badge (its owner filter lists integrations too).
- **Attribution fields (web payloads):** task comments `author_is_integration` (0/1), cards `creator_is_integration` (0/1), the board payload's `users[id].is_integration`, note versions `author_is_integration` (0/1), whiteboards `ownerIsIntegration`.
- **No MCP tools** manage integrations or their keys.

All routes: session, CSRF, Origin, TOTP gate; admins only (guests 404, everyone else 403 `ADMIN_ONLY`); writes share Team's 30-a-minute limit.

| Route | Body | Returns | Errors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/team/integrations` | | `{ integrations: [{ id, displayName, description, role, status: "active" \| "blocked" \| "retired", createdAt, createdBy, blockedAt, blockedBy, retiredAt, keys: { live }, lastUsedAt }], limit }` (active, then blocked, then retired) | |
| `POST /api/team/integrations` | `{ name ≤ 80, role: "member" \| "viewer", description? ≤ 200 }` | 201 `{ integration }` (detail) | 400 (role `admin`/`guest` fails validation), 409 `INTEGRATION_LIMIT` (100, retired ones not counted) |
| `GET /api/team/integrations/:id` | | `{ integration: { …, events, ownsContent, hadKeys }, keys: { keys, policy, liveCount } }` (the `/api/keys` shape for its keys; `policy.modules` never lists `inbox`) | 404 |
| `PATCH /api/team/integrations/:id` | `{ name?, description?, role?, expectedRole? }` | `{ changed, integration }` | 400 `SERVICE_ROLE`, 404, 409 `ROLE_CHANGED`, 409 `INTEGRATION_RETIRED` |
| `POST /api/team/integrations/:id/block` | `{ reason? }` | `{ blockedAt, sessionsRevoked: 0, mcpKeysPaused, integration }` | 404, 409 `ALREADY_BLOCKED`, 409 `INTEGRATION_RETIRED` |
| `POST /api/team/integrations/:id/unblock` | `{}` | `{ ok, integration }` | 404, 409 `NOT_BLOCKED`, 409 `INTEGRATION_RETIRED` |
| `DELETE /api/team/integrations/:id` | `{}` | Keys are revoked first (reason "Integration deleted"). `{ deleted: true, keysRevoked }` only when it **never had a key** and owns and wrote nothing (only its empty Default folder, its shares, and its logs); otherwise `{ deleted: false, retained: true, keysRevoked, integration }` with `status: "retired"`: kept blocked for good, so its keys' rows and usage history and its content keep its name. On a retired one: the same answer with `keysRevoked: 0`, and nothing changes | 404 |
| `GET /api/team/integrations/:id/resources?module=` | | `{ resources: [{ value: "kind:id", label, description?, writable }] }`: only items shared with the integration (the key builder's picker) | 400, 404 |
| `GET /api/team/integrations/:id/keys/:keyId` | | `{ key, events }` | 404 |
| `POST /api/team/integrations/:id/keys` | the `POST /api/keys` body; `password` (+ `totpCode`/`recoveryCode`) are **the admin's** | 201 `{ key: { …, token } }` (shown once) | the `/api/keys` codes checked against the integration (`SCOPE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `KEY_POLICY`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`, `KEY_LIMIT`), 401 `REAUTH_FAILED`, 409 `INTEGRATION_BLOCKED`, 409 `INTEGRATION_RETIRED`, 429 |
| `PATCH /api/team/integrations/:id/keys/:keyId` | the narrowing body (no password) | `{ changed, key }` | as `PATCH /api/keys/:id` |
| `POST /api/team/integrations/:id/keys/:keyId/rotate` | the rotate body; the admin's re-authentication | 201 `{ key: { …, token }, oldKey }` | as rotate, 409 `INTEGRATION_BLOCKED`, 409 `INTEGRATION_RETIRED` |
| `DELETE /api/team/integrations/:id/keys/:keyId` | `{}` | `{ ok }` (recorded as an admin revoke) | 404 |

Every write lands in `access_events` (`integration.created`, `integration.updated`, `integration.blocked`, `integration.unblocked`, `integration.deleted`, `integration.retired`, and the usual `key.*` rows with the admin as actor) and in the audit log (ids only). Team → Access activity shows them under "Google sign-in and integrations".

## Agent chat (Wave 40, AC-A)

[research/2026-09-30-agentic-chat-module.md](research/2026-09-30-agentic-chat-module.md) §12, D341–D370, T302–T326. Migration **039** (`agent_chat`) creates every table of the module and rebuilds `api_key_grants` with wider CHECK words. The module is on only with `AGENT_SECRETS_KEY`; every route below but `GET /api/agents/status` answers 503 `AGENTS_DISABLED` without it. While it is off because the key does not open a stored secret (`reason: "key_mismatch"`), the admin provider routes `GET`, `GET /:id`, `PATCH /:id` (to remove or re-enter a key), and `DELETE /:id` still answer, and a write decides the module's status again. Session, CSRF, Origin, and the TOTP gate apply; **guests get 404 on every path** (AC-O2); viewers chat through the write gate's allowlist while the `chat_roles` policy includes them. Responses are `no-store`; ids in paths that are not UUIDs are 404; missing and someone else's are the same 404. Errors are `{ error, code, ...details }`; validation is 400 `INVALID` naming fields only.

Bounds (`shared/agents.ts`): a user message 32 KiB, an assistant message 256 KiB (cut with a marker), 2,000 messages per chat, 5,000 chats per person, 5 providers, agent name 60, description 280, system prompt 16 KiB, `maxSteps` 1–25 (default 8), 4 starters, chat title 120.

| Route | Who | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/agents/status` | everyone but guests | | `{ enabled, reason: "unset" \| "key_mismatch" \| null (admins only), canChat, canCreate, defaultModel }` |
| `GET /api/agents/admin/settings` | admin (others 404) | | `{ settings: { createRoles, chatRoles, dailyTokensUser, dailyTokensKey, dailyTokensInstance, publicChatLinks (off by default; Wave 43 allows true), auditRetentionDays, agentsPerUser, kbsPerUser, defaultProviderId, revision } }` |
| `PUT /api/agents/admin/settings` | admin | any of those fields plus `expectedRevision` (the summed row revision) | `{ settings }`; 409 `REVISION_MISMATCH`; `publicChatLinks: true` was 400 until Wave 43 (AC-D), which allows it |
| `GET /api/agents/admin/providers` | admin | | `{ providers: [{ id, name, baseUrl, defaultModel, embeddingModel, embeddingDims, compat: { tokenParam, streamUsage, supportsTools, contextTokens }, isDefault, hasSecret, hint, revision, createdAt, updatedAt }] }` |
| `POST /api/agents/admin/providers` | admin | `{ name, baseUrl? (default https://api.openai.com/v1), apiKey?, defaultModel? (default gpt-6-luna), embeddingModel?, embeddingDims?, compat?, isDefault? }` | 201 `{ provider }`; the first one is the default; 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (5); 400 `EGRESS_REFUSED` (`field: "baseUrl"`) for a base URL the egress guard refuses by shape: scheme, credentials, fragment, Nook's own origin, plain http for an unlisted host, or a literal private/loopback address not in `AGENT_ALLOWED_PRIVATE_HOSTS` (no DNS at save time) |
| `GET /api/agents/admin/providers/:id` | admin | | `{ provider }` (`hint` is `sk-…a1B2`; the key itself is never returned, D354) |
| `PATCH /api/agents/admin/providers/:id` | admin | the create fields plus `expectedRevision`, `removeSecret?`; an empty or missing `apiKey` keeps the stored one | `{ provider }`; 409 `REVISION_MISMATCH`, 409 `DEFAULT_REQUIRED` |
| `DELETE /api/agents/admin/providers/:id` | admin | `{}` | `{ ok }` (another provider becomes the default) |
| `POST /api/agents/admin/providers/:id/test` | admin | `{}` | `{ test: { ok, models: { ok, count, latencyMs, error }, completion: { ok, model, latencyMs, error } } }`: `GET /models` and a one-token completion; errors are codes and bounded messages |
| `GET /api/agents/admin/providers/:id/models` | admin | `?fresh=1` | `{ models: [ids], cachedAt }` (cached ten minutes); 502 `PROVIDER_ERROR` |
| `GET /api/agents/admin/usage` | admin | `?from&to&group=user\|agent` | `{ from, to, group, rows: [{ day, id, name, runs, promptTokens, completionTokens }] }` (counts only, D73) |
| `GET /api/agents/usage` | chatters | | `{ usage: { day, promptTokens, completionTokens, runs, budget } }` (the caller's own day) |
| `GET /api/agents` | chatters | | `{ agents: [AgentSummary] }` (AC-A: the caller's own; no `systemPrompt`) |
| `GET /api/agents/providers` | `create_roles` (others who may chat 403 `ROLE_REFUSED`) | | `{ providers: [{ id, name, isDefault, defaultModel, models: [ids] \| null }] }`: the agent editor's picker, ordered default first then by name. `isDefault` is the provider an agent with `providerId: null` uses now (Settings → AI's default). `models` is the chat-model ids (ids containing "embed" left out, at most 200) from the admin's last Test or model list, kept in memory (null after a restart or before one); the editor then suggests `defaultModel` and takes free text. Never `baseUrl`, the key, `hint`, `hasSecret`, or `compat` |

Chat runs and API/MCP runs use the agent's provider, else the default |

| `GET /api/chats` | chatters | `?q=` (titles and the owner's messages, FTS, scoped to the owner inside the index) | `{ chats: [{ id, agentId, agentName, agentIcon, title, pinned, activeLeafId, revision, createdAt, updatedAt, running }] }`, pinned first then newest; `agentId` and `agentName` are `null` once the agent was purged from the Bin (the chat stays readable; sending is 409 `AGENT_GONE`) |
| `POST /api/chats` | chatters | `{ agentId }` | 201 `{ chat }` (title "New chat" until the first message) |
| `GET /api/chats/:id` | owner | | `{ chat, messages: [{ id, parentId, role, content, status, errorCode, model, usage, runId, createdAt, finishedAt }], activeRunId }` (the whole tree; the client shows the path to `activeLeafId`) |
| `PATCH /api/chats/:id` | owner | `{ title?, pinned?, activeLeafId?, expectedRevision }` | `{ chat }`; 404 for a leaf of another chat; 409 `REVISION_MISMATCH` |
| `DELETE /api/chats/:id` | owner | `{}` | `{ ok }`: to the Bin (type `chat`); a live run is cancelled |
| `POST /api/chats/:id/messages` | owner | `{ content, parentId? }` (absent: under the active leaf; `null`: a new first message; a sibling of an edited message passes that message's parent) | 201 `{ runId, userMessage, assistantMessage }`; the run streams on `/api/runs/:runId/events`. 400 `TOO_LARGE`; 403 `ROLE_REFUSED`; 409 `RUN_ACTIVE`, `NO_PROVIDER`, `AGENT_GONE`; 429 `AGENT_BUSY` (2 per person, `Retry-After`), 429 `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` (`retryAfterSeconds` to midnight UTC); 503 `AGENT_BUSY` (the instance) |
| `POST /api/chats/:id/messages/:mid/regenerate` | owner | `{}` | 201 `{ runId, userMessage: null, assistantMessage }`: a sibling assistant turn under the same user message (Retry on a user message makes a child) |

When the ring moved past `after` (or `after` is beyond everything the run emitted), or the run ended and its ring is gone (5 minutes), one `snapshot` event `{ status, messageId, content, messageStatus, usage, errorCode }` replaces the replay and the stream ends.

Message states: `streaming`, `complete`, `error`, `cancelled`, `interrupted`, `step_limit`. `features.agents` on sign-in and `/api/auth/me` says whether the person sees the module (never guests; admins also while it is off). The Bin lists `chat` and `agent` items to their owner (restore, purge, empty).

**MCP** (`agents:read`, grant `{ module: "agents", permission: "read" }`): `list_agents` → `{ agents: [{ id, name, description, model, providerName, maxSteps, updatedAt }] }` (`providerName` null: the default provider) (never the prompt); `list_chats({ query?, limit? })` → the key owner's chats with `url`; `get_chat({ chatId })` → the branch on screen (user and assistant turns, at most 200 and 256 KiB, `truncated`). All three declare `access: { mode: "own" }`, are read-only, and answer `NOT_FOUND` for other people's chats and while the module is off. `agents:run`, `run_agent`, and the REST runs are AC-C (below; `list_agents` then becomes a list tool).

### Tools (Wave 41, AC-B)

Plan §3, §4.1, §5.2–§5.4, D346–D353, D358, D359, T302–T313, T318, T319, T324. No new migration (039 created `agent_tool_servers`, `agent_tool_policies`, `agent_tools`, and `agent_user_links`). Bounds (`shared/agents.ts`): 20 tool servers, a server name 60 and slug 1–24 (`[a-z0-9_-]`), a URL 512, a tool timeout 5–120 s (default 30), a result cap 1–64 KiB (default 16), 50 tool calls per run, argument and result excerpts of 1 KiB on messages and events, a 15-minute confirmation wait.

| Route | Who | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/agents/admin/servers` | admin (others 404) | | `{ servers: [ToolServerSummary], stdio: { enabled, declared: [{ id, name, command, args, envNames, adopted }] } }`; `declared` is empty unless `AGENT_MCP_STDIO=on`. A summary is `{ id, slug, name, transport: "http" \| "stdio", url, stdioId, authKind: "none" \| "bearer" \| "header", authHeader, hasSecret, hint, timeoutMs, resultCapBytes, availability: "admins" \| "all", enabled, status: "unknown" \| "ok" \| "auth_failed" \| "unreachable" \| "error", lastError (≤ 200 characters, never a URL), tools: [{ name, title, description, inputSchema, readOnly, openWorld, destructive, policy }], toolsSyncedAt, revision, createdAt, updatedAt }` |
| `POST /api/agents/admin/servers` | admin | `{ name, slug?, url?, stdioId?, authKind?, authHeader?, secret?, timeoutMs?, resultCapBytes?, availability?, enabled? }` (`url` xor `stdioId`; `authKind` other than `none` needs `secret`; `header` needs a plain `authHeader`, never Authorization, Cookie, or a transport header) | 201 `{ server }`; 400 for a URL the egress guard refuses by shape (http, userinfo, a fragment, this Nook's origin), for a stdio id unless the flag is on and the file declares it; 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (20), `NAME_TAKEN` (slug, or a declared server already adopted) |
| `GET /api/agents/admin/servers/:id` | admin | | `{ server }` (the credential is never returned, D354) |
| `PATCH /api/agents/admin/servers/:id` | admin | the create fields plus `expectedRevision`, `removeSecret?`; an empty or missing `secret` keeps the stored one; a stdio server's URL and auth are fixed | `{ server }`; 409 `REVISION_MISMATCH`, `NAME_TAKEN`. A change closes the cached MCP session |
| `DELETE /api/agents/admin/servers/:id` | admin | `{}` | `{ ok }`: immediate (no Bin, as for providers); policies and agents' picks go by cascade; agents lose the tools at their next step |
| `POST /api/agents/admin/servers/:id/sync` | admin | `{}` | `{ server }` with the catalog from `tools/list` (paged, ≤ 500 tools), `status: "ok"`, and a policy per tool: an existing admin policy is kept, a new tool gets `auto` when the server says `readOnlyHint: true`, else `confirm` (D349). On failure the previous catalog stays and `status`/`lastError` say why (`auth_failed` for 401/403, `unreachable` for the egress guard, DNS, network, or a timeout, `error` otherwise) |
| `PUT /api/agents/admin/servers/:id/policies` | admin | `{ policies: { [toolName]: "auto" \| "confirm" \| "off" } }` | `{ server }`; 404 for a tool not in the catalog |
| `GET /api/agents/catalog` | chatters | `?agentId=` | `{ catalog: { servers: [{ id, slug, name, enabled, status, availability, tools: [{ name, title, description, readOnly, openWorld, policy }] }], nook: { linked, linkState: "none" \| "live" \| "revoked" \| "expired" \| "inactive", tools: [{ name, title, module, write, proposable, scope, proposalScope }] } } }`. Servers: all for admins, else the enabled ones open to everyone. Nook: with `agentId` and a linked live key, the tools that key reaches (as `tools/list` would, plus proposable writes it may suggest); without a live key, none (Wave 41 QA Q4: `linkState` says why; picks are validated against the allowlist of tools agents may use). Never offered: proposal and routine machinery, uploads, Bin, the agent module's own tools, `run_agent` (T318) |
| `GET /api/agents/:id/link` | chatters with the agent | | `{ link: { keyId, name, prefix, state } \| null, keys: [{ id, name, prefix, state, expiresAt, grants: [{ module, permission, resource: { kind, name } \| null, active }] }] }`: the caller's own live `general` keys with the MCP surface |
| `PUT /api/agents/:id/link` | chatters with the agent | `{ nookKeyId \| null }` | `{ link }`; 404 for a key that is not the caller's own live general key with the MCP surface (D359). A pointer is stored, never a token |
| `POST /api/runs/:runId/confirm` | the chat's owner | `{ confirmationId, argsHash, decision: "once" \| "deny" }` (the card's server nonce, 32 hex, and the SHA-256 of its arguments, 64 hex) | `{ ok, decision: "allowed" \| "denied" }`; 404 for another person's run; 409 `NO_PENDING_CONFIRMATION` when the run waits on nothing, on another card, or the hash differs (single use, T324, Wave 41 review M1) |

**Agents** gain `tools: [{ source: "server", serverId, toolName, policy: "confirm" \| "off" \| null } \| { source: "nook", toolName }]` (`POST`/`PATCH` replace the list; a server tool must be in a catalog the editor may see, a Nook tool must be offered; 400 `INVALID` otherwise), `nookDirectWrites` (AC-O11, default false), `linked` (whether the caller linked a key), and `trifecta` (Nook tools plus a remote tool whose `openWorldHint` is not false, plan §5.2). An agent's policy on a server tool can only be stricter than the admin's (`off` wins, then `confirm`); `off` tools are never offered.

**Chats and runs.** `GET /api/chats/:id` gains `pendingConfirmation: { confirmationId, argsHash, callId, tool, server, args, expiresAt, proposal } \| null`, and every message `toolCalls: [{ id, tool, server, serverId, argsPreview, resultPreview, ok, truncated, durationMs, decision, proposalId }]` (excerpts of 1 KiB, never a whole result; stored on the assistant turn as `tool_calls_json`, bounded at 64 KiB with the newest kept). The run stream gains `tool_call` `{ messageId, callId, tool, server, serverId, argsPreview }`, `tool_result` `{ messageId, callId, ok, resultPreview, truncated, durationMs, decision, proposalId }`, `confirmation_required` `{ messageId, confirmationId, argsHash, callId, tool, server, args, expiresAt, proposal }`, and `confirmation_resolved` `{ messageId, confirmationId, callId, decision: "allowed" \| "denied" \| "expired" }` (call ids are Nook's, `call_<step>_<index>`, never the model's); `snapshot` carries `toolCalls` and `pendingConfirmation`. While a card waits, the run and its message are `awaiting_confirmation`; 15 minutes without an answer is Deny, and Stop cancels the run. The loop (plan §2.1): tools are re-resolved every step against live rights (server enabled and available to the runner, policy not `off`, the linked key live and the runner's own); one call at a time in the model's order; the last step goes out without tools and a model that still wants one ends `step_limit`; at most 10 calls run per step and 50 per answer (calls past either are dropped with one count on `agents.run.finish` and a note to the model), each call is re-resolved against live rows just before it runs and after any confirmation (`TOOL_UNAVAILABLE` when the server, its revision, the policy, the key, the mode, the agent, or the role changed), only the last 20 tool results stay whole in the model view; a tool the model invents answers `unknown tool`, invalid JSON `arguments were not valid JSON`, a refusal `DENIED`, a timeout `TOOL_TIMEOUT`, all as tool results the run continues from. Every result the model sees is `[Untrusted tool result <nonce> from <server>/<tool>. …]`, then text cut to the server's cap with a `[truncated: …]` note, then `[End of untrusted tool result <nonce>]` (D350, D351). Nook's tools run in process through `runTool` with the linked key (`agents.tool.call` audit rows carry ids, names, counts, and the proposal id, never arguments or results); a write in proposal mode files `submit_proposal` with the matching kind (`create_card` → `card_create`, `update_card`, `comment_on_card`, `create_event`, `update_event`, `create_row`, `update_row`, `create_note`/`update_note_draft` → `note_draft`) and answers `{ proposed: true, proposalId, … }`; a write without a kind is offered only with direct writes and otherwise refused with `KIND_NOT_ALLOWED`.

### External runs and the Audit log (Wave 42, AC-C)

Plan §2, §7, D364–D366, T310, T314, T317–T319. Migration **040** (`agent_audit`) adds the Audit log's append-only triggers, the retention guard, the per-key run windows (`agent_rate_limits`), and two reader indexes; the tables are 039's. Bounds (`shared/agents.ts` `EXTERNAL_BOUNDS`): `input` 32 KiB; `messages` ≤ 50 turns and 128 KiB in total, ending with a `user` turn; `label` ≤ 60 characters on one line; a run's wall clock 5 minutes (or `AGENT_RUN_TIMEOUT_S` if lower); each step's text, a tool call's arguments, and its result kept up to 16 KiB in the log (`truncated` flags a cut); 50 runs a page; 1,000 runs an export.

**Keys and grants.** The scope `agents:run` is the grant `{ module: "agents", permission: "run" }` on every agent (`resourceKind: null`) or on chosen agents (`resources: [{ kind: "agent", id }]`, or bare `resourceIds`). It is member-only (`MEMBER_ONLY_SCOPES`), implies no read (it never reads chats), and is validated on `POST /api/keys`, `PATCH` (narrowing only: all → chosen, fewer agents), and rotation: a chosen agent must be the creator's own live agent (404 `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` otherwise; until AC-D shares agents, "can view" is "owns"); an agent moved to the Bin later lists the grant as inactive (`no-access`). `agents:read` covers every agent and chat: chosen agents on it are 400 `INVALID_GRANT` (Wave 44: it may name chosen knowledge bases instead; see *Knowledge bases*).

**The effective right** of a key on an agent is: the key live (not revoked, expired, past its grace, or its holder blocked; team policy and the surface allow it), a general key, its effective `agents:run` covering the agent, the owner's role in `chat_roles`, and the agent the owner's own and not in the Bin. It is checked when a run starts (404 without it), before every model call, and before every tool call; a run that loses it ends `status: "error"`, `error.code: "KEY_INACTIVE"` at that point (T319).

**REST** (`/api/v1/agents/*`, the v1 rules: Bearer only, never a cookie; `KEY_IN_URL`; Host and Origin checks; JSON only with `Content-Type: application/json`; no CORS; `no-store`; errors `{ error, code }`; every request also counts against the key's per-minute REST `call` bucket). A vault key gets 403 `KEY_POLICY`; a key without the REST surface 403 `KEY_POLICY`; a revoked key 401 `KEY_INVALID`.

| Route | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/agents` | | `{ agents: [{ id, name, description, model, providerName, maxSteps, tools: ["<server>/<tool>", "nook/<tool>"] }] }`: the owner's live agents the grant covers, with the tools a run may use now; never the system prompt |
| `POST /api/v1/agents/:id/runs` | `{ input }` or `{ messages: [{ role: "user" \| "assistant", content }] }`, `stream?`, `label?` | Without `stream`: 200 `ExternalRunResult` = `{ runId, agentId, status, output, steps, toolCalls: [{ name, server, ok, durationMs }], usage: { promptTokens, completionTokens, estimated }, timings: { queuedMs, firstTokenMs, totalMs }, error: { code, message } \| null, label }` (a failed run is still 200 with `status` and `error`). With `stream: true`: 200 `text/event-stream` with frames `id: <seq>`, `event: run` `{ runId, agentId }`, `delta` `{ text }` (coalesced to one per 50 ms, and flushed before the step's `usage` and before a `tool_call`, so a plain run reads `run`, `delta`…, `usage`, `done`), `tool_call` `{ callId, tool, server, argsPreview }`, `tool_result` `{ callId, ok, truncated, durationMs, resultPreview }` (excerpts ≤ 1 KiB), `usage` `{ usage }`, `error` `{ code, message }`, and `done` with the `ExternalRunResult`; a `: ping` comment every 15 s; no confirmation events. A disconnect never cancels the run. Refusals, before the provider is called and before anything is written: 404 `NOT_FOUND` (no right; missing, someone else's, outside the grant, and malformed ids alike), 400 `INVALID` / `INVALID_JSON` (a blank `input` or `messages` turn; a `label` that is not one line: no C0, DEL, C1, U+2028, or U+2029), 409 `AGENT_RECURSION` (the request carries `Nook-Agent-Run`, sent by Nook on every MCP request made inside a run), 415, 409 `NO_PROVIDER`, 429 `AGENT_BUSY` (2 per key; 2 per owner, shared with chats), 429 `RATE_LIMITED` (20 starts a minute, 500 a UTC day per key, kept in `agent_rate_limits`), 429 `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` (the key's `dailyTokensKey`, the owner's `dailyTokensUser`, which now counts their API runs too, and the instance's), each with `Retry-After`; 503 `AGENT_BUSY` (`AGENT_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`, at most 16; or, without `stream`, 12 plain runs already holding half of the 24 REST request slots), 503 `AGENTS_DISABLED`. `AGENT_BUSY` carries `scope: "key" \| "owner" \| "instance"` |
| `GET /api/v1/agents/:id/runs/:runId` | | The `ExternalRunResult` (live: `status: "running"`, the output so far, `timings.totalMs: null`); 404 for any other key, even the same owner's, and for another agent in the path |
| `POST /api/v1/agents/:id/runs/:runId/cancel` | none or `{}` | `{ status: "cancelled" }`, or the ended run's status; the same key only (404 otherwise) |

Run status: `ok`, `step_limit`, `cancelled`, `timeout`, `budget` (`BUDGET_EXCEEDED` between steps), `error` (`KEY_INACTIVE`, also within 2 s while a model call streams; `PROVIDER_ERROR`, `MODEL_TIMEOUT`, `EGRESS_REFUSED`, `TOO_LARGE`, `INTERNAL`), `interrupted` (a restart). A run that ends during a model call (cancel, timeout, `KEY_INACTIVE`) keeps its output so far and is charged that call's usage: the provider's when reported, else estimated (`estimated: true`); the call is a model step in the Audit log. A model call that asks for a tool when none is offered ends the output with "[The model tried to use a tool, but no tools were available to it here, so the answer stops. Over the API and MCP an agent gets only the tools that run on their own; …]". **Tools over the API** (D352): only `auto` ones, i.e. remote tools whose effective policy is `auto`, Nook read tools, and Nook writes in proposal mode (they file Inbox proposals for the key's owner, "Suggested by the agent … in an API run"); a `confirm` tool and a direct Nook write are never offered (a call to one anyway is "unknown tool"). The calling key is the Nook key, on its own surface (`runTool(…, "rest")` or `"mcp"`). Runs never create chats (D365; a trigger refuses an API or MCP run row with a `chat_id` or without a `key_id`). `audit_log` rows `agents.run.start` / `agents.run.finish` / `agents.tool.call` carry `via`, ids, names, counts, and token totals only.

**MCP.** `run_agent({ agentId, input (≤ 32 KiB), label? })` under `agents:run`, `access: { mode: "items", items: [{ arg: "agentId", kind: "agent" }] }`: the same run, non-streaming, `via: "mcp"`, answering the `ExternalRunResult`; `label` follows the REST rule (one line). Errors carry the run's own code (review L5), with `retryAfterSeconds` when there is one: `NOT_FOUND` without the right; `AGENT_BUSY` (with `scope`; REST 429, or 503 when `scope` is `instance`, including 12 calls already waiting on the surface: half of its 24 request slots), `RATE_LIMITED` (429), `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` (429), `NO_PROVIDER` (409); `AGENT_RECURSION` (REST 409) when called from inside any agent run (an AsyncLocalStorage frame around every chat, API, and MCP run, T318) or with a `Nook-Agent-Run` header (`POST /api/v1/tools/run_agent`, and an MCP `tools/call` of `run_agent` over HTTP: 409 `{ error, code: "AGENT_RECURSION" }`); `AGENTS_DISABLED` (REST 503). `run_agent` is never among the Nook tools agents are offered. `list_agents` now also answers keys with only `agents:run` (`access: { mode: "list", lists: ["agent"] }`), listing the agents the grant covers.

**The Audit log** (session API; the module on; guests 404):

| Route | Who | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/agents/status` | everyone but guests | gains `auditVisible`: admins, and people who hold or held a key with `agents:run` or have runs |
| `GET /api/agents/audit?key&agent&owner&status&from&to&cursor` | any reader | `{ runs: [AuditRunSummary], nextCursor }`, newest first, 50 a page. Non-admins: their own runs only. Admins: every key's runs (`owner` filters). `status` is a run status or a group (`ok`, `failed` = error/timeout/budget/interrupted, `cancelled`, `step_limit`, `running`); `from`/`to` are `YYYY-MM-DD` (UTC days); 400 `INVALID` otherwise. A summary is `{ id, via: "api" \| "mcp", agentId, agentName, key: { id, name, prefix } \| null, owner: { id, displayName }, status, errorCode, model, steps, toolCalls, promptTokens, completionTokens, estimated, queuedAt, startedAt, firstTokenAt, finishedAt, durationMs, label (the owner only, else null), full }` |
| `GET /api/agents/audit/facets` | any reader | `{ facets: { keys: [{ id, name, prefix, own, ownerName }], agents: [{ id, name, own }] } }`, the filter sheet's choices whether or not they have runs on the loaded page (QA M3): the reader's own general keys that hold `agents:run` or have runs (revoked ones included), and their own agents (plus agents of their runs since binned or purged); admins also get the key name and prefix (with the owner's name) and the agent name of every run they can see, `own: false`, never content. At most 500 of each |
| `GET /api/agents/audit/:runId` | the key's owner; admins | `{ run: AuditRunDetail }` = the summary plus `input`, `output`, `timeline: [{ seq, kind: "model" \| "tool", server, tool, ok, truncated, durationMs, promptTokens, completionTokens, text, args, result }]`, `toolNames`, `agentRevision`, `preambleVersion`, `clientAddress` (the /24 or /64), `purgeAfter`. For an admin who is not the owner, `input`, `output`, `label`, `clientAddress`, and every step's `text`, `args`, and `result` are `null` (D73, D366). Anyone else: 404 |
| `GET /api/agents/audit/export?runId \| filters` | the reader, own runs only | `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="nook-agent-run-<id>.json"` (or `nook-agent-audit-<day>.json`), `Cache-Control: no-store`: `{ exportedAt, count, truncated, runs: [AuditRunDetail] }`, at most 1,000 runs; an admin's export holds their own runs only; another person's `runId` is 404 |
| `GET /api/agents/:id/api-usage` | the agent's owner (its managers) | `{ usage: { days: [{ day, runs, errors, promptTokens, completionTokens }], totals } }`: the last 30 days of API and MCP runs, counts only |

**Append-only (migration 040).** A finished API or MCP run row cannot change, and a live one never changes its identity columns; `agent_audit_steps` never change; `agent_audit_entries` change once, to fill `output_text` while the run is live. Deletes: only by the hourly retention sweep (`AGENT_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 30, 7–365; an admin's stored `auditRetentionDays` policy wins), 500 runs per batch inside the `agent_retention_guard` row, never a run younger than 7 days; and by the cascade when a key row is deleted. Revoking a key keeps its runs.

## Agent chat sharing (Wave 43, AC-D)

[research/2026-09-30-agentic-chat-module.md](research/2026-09-30-agentic-chat-module.md) §6.2, D356, D359, D361–D363, AC-O1, T311, T315, T316. Migration **041** (`agent_sharing`) re-creates `access_grants_v` with `agent_access` rows, makes `agent_access` one row per principal and item, and adds `chats.copied_from_user_id` / `copied_from_name`. Levels are live and capped by the Team role (viewers at `view`); guests never reach Chat (AC-O2) and are refused by name; `all_users` never includes guests or integrations; admins have no special reach (D73: the same 404).

| Route | Who | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/agents` | chatters | | `{ agents: [AgentSummary] }`: own first, then shared; each has `yourLevel: owner\|manage\|view`, `ownerName`, `usesNook`, `hiddenTools`. Below `manage`, `tools` is `[]` and `nookDirectWrites` false. A manager's `tools` leaves out picks from servers outside the manager's own catalog; `hiddenTools` counts them (0 for everyone else) |
| `GET /api/agents/:id` | owner, manager, viewer | | `{ agent }`; `systemPrompt` is `null` below `manage` |
| `PATCH /api/agents/:id` | owner, manager | as before | viewer 403 `READ_ONLY`; others 404. A manager's save keeps server tools the owner picked from servers the manager cannot see (re-merged on save). When a manager changes `systemPrompt`, `tools`, or `nookDirectWrites`, or the change turns on the trifecta, the owner gets the bell notice `agent_changed` |

**MCP:** `list_agents` includes shared agents (never the prompt); `list_chats` adds chats shared with the key's owner after their own (`shared: true`, `ownerName`); `get_chat` reads them too, with tool names per turn. **REST v1 / `run_agent`:** an `agents:run` grant on chosen agents may name an agent the key's owner can view (their own or shared), re-checked on every call and step.

**Notifications:** a bell line "X shared the agent “…” with you" (or the chat), for people added by name or through a newly granted group, naming the item only while they can open it (`/chat/new?agent=` or `/chat/:id`); the `sharing.shared` mail for people added by name. To an agent's owner: "<manager> changed the system prompt, the tools, and direct Nook writes on your agent “…”" (the fields that changed; plus a trifecta sentence when the change turned it on), opening `/settings/agents/:id`.

**Images in chats (2026-10-07, D370 as amended, T304; migration 043 `chat_tool_images`).** Both routes answer image bytes only, with the sniffed `Content-Type` (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`; never SVG), `Content-Disposition: inline`, and the content route's header set (`default-src 'none'; sandbox`, `nosniff`, `no-referrer`, same-origin CORP, `private, no-store`).

| Route | Who | Input | Output and errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/agents/image-proxy?url=<http(s) URL>` | a session (never an API key), not guests, module on; header `X-Nook-Image-Proxy: 1` required, `Sec-Fetch-Site` same-origin when sent | `url` ≤ 2,048 characters, no credentials or fragment | 200 the picture (≤ 5 MiB); 400 `INVALID` (no header, no or long URL) or `URL_REFUSED` (not https, a port other than 443, credentials, Nook itself); 403 `FORBIDDEN` (another site); 415 `NOT_AN_IMAGE` (an SVG address); 429 `RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` (60 a minute, 4 at a time per person); **502 `IMAGE_UNAVAILABLE` "That image could not be loaded" for every failure on the far side** (DNS, a private address, a redirect, a status other than 200, a timeout, over 5 MiB, bytes that are not PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP). Fetched with `egressFetch` and an empty private-host allowlist (never `AGENT_ALLOWED_PRIVATE_HOSTS`), aborted when the browser leaves; no cookie or key sent; logs name the host and reason only |
| `GET /api/chats/:chatId/tool-images/:imageId` | whoever can read the chat (owner; recipients for messages on the active branch only) | | 200 the picture; 404 otherwise (as for the chat) |

The run stream's `tool_result` and every stored tool call gain `images?: [{ id, mimeType, bytes }]` when an MCP tool returned pictures (at most 4 a call, 12 a run, 2 MiB each); the model's tool turn says `[image: <type>, <n> KiB]` and whether the picture was shown or not kept (the run's limit, the chat owner's storage quota, the free-disk floor). Pictures are stored once by content and count once against the chat owner's quota. `POST /api/chats/:id/fork` adds references to the pictures of the messages it copies (same image ids, the copy's message ids); a recipient may continue only from a message on the active branch (404 otherwise). The public snapshot carries none.

## Knowledge bases (Wave 44, AC-E)

[research/2026-09-30-agentic-chat-module.md](research/2026-09-30-agentic-chat-module.md) §5.2, §9, §12, D367–D369, AC-O14, T320, T321. Migration **042** (`knowledge`) re-creates `kb_chunk_fts` with the heading path as a second column and keeps it in step with triggers on `kb_chunks`, adds `kb_sources.chunk_count`, `bytes`, `added_by`, `created_at`, a unique index on `(kb_id, kind, ref_id)`, and a trigger that removes agents' picks of a purged base. Every route needs a session and a role in the `chat_roles` policy (403 `ROLE_REFUSED` otherwise; guests 404 everywhere, AC-O2, writes included: the role write gate lets a guest's write under `/api/knowledge` through to the module's 404, never `ROLE_READ_ONLY`); with the module off, 503 `AGENTS_DISABLED`. Levels come from `agent_access` (`resource_kind = 'knowledge_base'`): **view** = search it (Try it); **manage** = also add and remove sources, rename, re-index, attach it to agents (Wave 44 fixes, operator 2026-10-06), and share at view; the owner alone moves it to the Bin. Team viewers are capped at view; admins have no special reach (D73). Missing and forbidden are the same 404; a viewer who tries to change a base gets 403 `READ_ONLY`, a manager who tries to bin it 403 `OWNER_ONLY`.

| Route | Who | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/knowledge` | chatters | | `{ knowledgeBases: [KnowledgeSummary] }`: own first, then shared; each `{ id, name, description, ownerId, ownerName, yourLevel: owner\|manage\|view, embeddingModel, dims, status: empty\|indexing\|ready\|error, chunkCount, sourceCount, counts: { pending, indexing, ready, error, unavailable }, audience (owner only), revision, createdAt, updatedAt, notice }`. `notice` (Wave 44 fixes) is null, or why the base is not working normally: its embedding provider was removed (keyword search only, nothing indexed), or its owner is blocked (paused, answers no search) |
| `POST /api/knowledge` | `create_roles` (admins and members) | `{ name ≤ 60, description? ≤ 280 }` | 201 `{ knowledgeBase }`. The default provider and its embedding model and size are fixed now (AC-O14: `text-embedding-3-small`, 512); 409 `NO_PROVIDER`, 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` (`kbsPerUser`, 10) |
| `GET /api/knowledge/:id` | view+ | | `{ knowledgeBase: KnowledgeSummary & { sources: [{ id, kind: note\|document\|text, title, titleHidden, refId, status: pending\|indexing\|ready\|error\|unavailable, error, chunkCount, indexedAt, createdAt, bytes }] } }`. Below manage, a note or file source the reader cannot open has `title: null`, `refId: null`, `titleHidden: true` (T320) |
| `PATCH /api/knowledge/:id` | manage+ | `{ name?, description? }` | `{ knowledgeBase }` |
| `DELETE /api/knowledge/:id` | owner | `{}` | `{ ok, purgeAfter }`: to the Bin (type `knowledge_base`, folder "Knowledge"); restore and purge through `/api/bin/knowledge_base/:id`. A restore answers `{ ok, knowledgeBaseId, knowledgeBaseName }` (`alreadyRestored: true` when it was) |
| `POST /api/knowledge/:id/sources` | manage+ | `{ kind: "note", noteId }` \| `{ kind: "document", documentId }` \| `{ kind: "text", title ≤ 120, text ≤ 256 KiB }` | 201 `{ source }` (`pending`; indexed in the background). A note or file must be readable by **both** the caller and the base's owner now (404 otherwise, the same as missing); a file must be a Files text upload (`text/plain`, `text/markdown`, or `text/csv`) named `.txt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, or `.csv` (a `.csv` name is chunked as CSV; `.json` and every other name are refused) of at most 1 MiB (400 `UNSUPPORTED_TYPE`, `TOO_LARGE`); 409 `SOURCE_EXISTS`; 409 `LIMIT_REACHED` past 500 sources |
| `DELETE /api/knowledge/:id/sources/:sourceId` | manage+ | `{}` | `{ ok }`: the source and its chunks go; the base's revision moves |
| `GET /api/knowledge/:id/candidates?kind=note\|document&q=` | manage+ | | `{ candidates: [{ id, title, detail, added }] }`: at most 50 published notes, or Files text documents of 1 MiB or less (whiteboards excluded), that both the caller and the owner can read, matching `q` |
| `POST /api/knowledge/:id/reindex` | manage+ | `{}` | `{ ok, sources }`: every source is marked `pending` with its hash cleared (embedded again). At most once an hour per base, for everyone (the owner too): sooner is 429 `REINDEX_RATE_LIMITED` with `Retry-After` (seconds) and `retryAfterSeconds` |
| `POST /api/knowledge/:id/search` | view+ (viewers too: a read sent as POST) | `{ query ≤ 500, k? 1–8 }` | `{ hits: [{ kb: { id, name }, heading, source: { kind, id?, title? }, text ≤ 2,000, score, ranks: { vector, keyword } }], mode: hybrid\|keyword }`. `source.id` and `source.title` only for a note or file the caller can open now (pasted text keeps its title). The query's embedding is charged to the caller; `mode: keyword` when any part of it could not be made (provider down, budget used up, the base's provider removed), with `notice` when the provider was removed. A blocked owner's base answers no hits. A hit whose note or file the base's owner can no longer read is dropped (its source is marked `unavailable` just after). Below the ability to open a note or file source, the heading path leaves out its first segment when that is the source's own title (the note's H1) |
| `GET /api/knowledge/:id/access`, `PUT …/access` | owner, manager (403 for viewers, 404 otherwise) | the Access sheet's body with `If-Match` | `ItemAccess` (`kind: "knowledge_base"`, `levels: ["view","manage"]` for the owner, `["view"]` for a manager, `guestsExcluded: true`); the same errors as agents (428, 409 `ACCESS_CHANGED`, 400 `LEVEL_NOT_OFFERED`, `GUEST_NOT_ALLOWED`, 403 `MANAGER_CAP`) |

**Indexing.** A background queue (bases in turn, at most 20 sources of one base per pass) reads each `pending` source **as the base's owner**: a note's current published version (checked against its stored checksum), a Files document (checked against its SHA-256), or the pasted text. A source whose content hash (`sha256(chunker version | provider id | provider base URL | model | dims | format | the content's checksum)`) is unchanged is not embedded again. The base's own provider is used, never the default: when it was removed every source gets `error` "The embedding provider was removed" and nothing is sent; when its base URL changes, every source of its bases is embedded again. Chunks are Markdown-aware (heading paths "A › B", ~3,200 characters, 15% overlap; a question heading or a `Q:`/`A:` pair is one chunk; CSV in 20-row chunks with the header repeated) and embedded with `POST {baseUrl}/embeddings` in batches of 64 at 512 dimensions (`max(1, floor(64 × 512 / dims))`: 10 at 3,072; `dimensions` for text-embedding-3 models), L2-normalized, stored as little-endian float32. Before every request the owner's (and the instance's) daily token budget is checked; over it every waiting source of the base stays `pending` with "Paused…" and nothing is sent; the queue wakes just after midnight UTC, or when an admin changes a daily budget. A blocked owner's bases are not indexed or swept until the unblock. Tokens are charged to the owner under `agent_usage_daily.agent_id = 'kb:<id>'` (Settings → AI → Usage by agent shows "Knowledge · <name>"). A provider or egress failure marks the source `error` (keeping any chunks it had). A note or file the owner can no longer read becomes `unavailable` and its chunks are removed, at once when the note, file, or its folder is unshared, moved to the Bin, moved to another folder, or purged (a purge also replaces the source's title with "Deleted note" or "Deleted file", in binned bases too); a restore or a share back makes it `pending` again. Triggers: adding a source; publishing a note that is a source (60 s debounce); the hourly sweep (readability of `pending`, `ready`, `error`, and `unavailable` sources, and a changed checksum → `pending`; it yields to requests every 50 sources); Re-index all; a restart puts `indexing` sources back to `pending` and resumes. At most 10,000 chunks per base (a source that would pass it is `error`).

**Search.** Cosine (a dot product of unit vectors) over each base's vectors, loaded lazily into one `Float32Array` per base and kept in a 128 MiB LRU keyed by the base's revision, fused with FTS5 BM25 over the heading (weight 2) and text by reciprocal rank fusion (k = 60), 50 candidates from each list, top `k` (5 by default, 8 at most).

**Agents.** A tool pick `{ source: "knowledge", kbId }` (in `POST/PATCH /api/agents`) attaches a base: the editor and the agent's owner must both **own or manage** it (Wave 44 fixes, operator 2026-10-06: attaching needs manage). A base the editor cannot open is 400 `INVALID`; one they or the agent's owner only view is 403 `KB_MANAGE_REQUIRED`. A pick already on the agent stays valid on save; a manager's save keeps picks of bases the manager does not manage, counted in `hiddenTools`. `GET /api/agents/catalog` gains `knowledge: [{ id, name, description, ownerName, yours, manageable, status, chunkCount }]` (every base the editor can open; only `manageable` ones can be attached). At every step the attached bases that are live and still **owned or managed** by the agent's owner become **one** tool (a base moved down to view drops out like a binned one), `knowledge__search_knowledge({ query ≤ 500, kb? (enum of the attached ids), k? 1–8 })`, policy `auto`, offered over the API and MCP too; it returns `{ results: [{ heading, source, kb, score, text }], note? }` behind the untrusted-result marker (`note` when it matched by keywords only), with `source.id`/`title` only for notes and files the **runner** can open (chat: the person chatting; API and MCP runs: the key's owner). Its stream and message rows show `server: "knowledge"`, `tool: "search_knowledge"`. An attached base counts as private data for the trifecta badge.

**Keys and MCP.** `agents:read` may now name chosen knowledge bases: `{ module: "agents", permission: "read", resources: [{ kind: "knowledge_base", id }] }` (a base the creator can open; agents are refused on read, bases on run: 400 `INVALID_GRANT`). The MCP and REST tool `search_knowledge({ query, kb?, k? })` needs `agents:read`; it searches every base the key's owner can open that the grant covers (all, or the chosen ones), `kb` narrows to one (NOT_FOUND outside), and answers `{ results: [{ heading, kb: { id, name }, source, score, text }], mode, note?, bases }`; the query's tokens count toward the owner and the key; the call is kept open past the idle timeout while the query is embedded (as `run_agent`). `list_chats` and `get_chat` are `global` now: a key whose `agents:read` names only chosen bases does not see them, nor `list_agents` (a list tool with `listsNeedReach`: hidden unless the key reaches agents). `list_agents` lists every agent only when `agents:read` reaches everything (`keyReach`, not the scopes), else the agents `agents:run` covers. `search_knowledge` is never one of Nook's tools offered to agents (T318).

**Notifications:** "X shared the knowledge base “…” with you" (`knowledge_base_shared`), opening `/settings/knowledge/:id`, named only while the recipient can open it; no mail. Team → member access lists knowledge bases in the Chat section (`kind: "knowledge_base"`), with the same reductions as agents.

## Changes to existing note endpoints (Wave 4)

- `DELETE /api/notes/:id`:
  - Blank never-published note → purged immediately → `{ ok: true, purged: true }`.
  - Any other note → moved to the Bin → `{ ok: true, purgeAfter }`.
  - The response is 404 for missing notes, as it is today.
- `DELETE /api/notes/:id/draft` on a never-published note:
  - Blank → purged immediately.
  - Content → moved to the Bin with the draft file and `draft_revision`/`draft_checksum` **kept** (today this route deletes them). The response still returns `{ ok: true }`, plus `binned: true`, so the client can pick the right toast.
- "Blank" means `current_version = 0` and the draft is absent or empty after `trim()` (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN §9.1).
- Unchanged: every read endpoint continues to exclude `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`. So do all MCP tools.
