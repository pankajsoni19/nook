# Nook implementation tracker

Only open work lives here. Shipped work is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), the docs site ("What's new") and `git log`. Plans of record: `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` and `docs/plan/research/`. Contracts: [API](docs/plan/API_CONTRACTS.md) · [Threat model](docs/plan/THREAT_MODEL.md) · [Test plan](docs/plan/TEST_PLAN.md).

**Current state (2026-10-08):** production runs **v0.33.0** (`2831b31`: knowledge-base model change, passage previews, groups, per-key search limits; chat-role notice, cut-reply charging, push labels; backup `mynotes-20261008T070848Z.tar.gz`). Released migrations are immutable: **001–044**. Messages takes **045**.

## In flight

Nothing. Waiting for the operator's next pick.

## Next features (operator to pick)

- [ ] **Messages module** (Slack-like: channels, DMs, threads, notes tab, webhooks, unfurl, reactions). The plan is ready: `docs/plan/research/2026-09-30-messages-module.md`, migration 045. Waiting for the operator's go-ahead.

## Known LOW leftovers

None open.

## Standing rules for agent briefs

- Subagents run on Opus 5.5 at medium effort, each in its own worktree with pre-assigned ports and migration ids. Releases are serial.
- Never stop processes by name or pattern (no pkill/killall); stop only your own pids. Production and QA containers run `bun server/index.ts` as the same host user.
- Browser QA uses its own `<lane>.localhost:<port>` origin and its own tab or profile, because the session cookie is shared across localhost ports.
- Tests that spawn `bun` use `--no-env-file`. The Docker verify image has no `docs/` and no `git`: guard with `test.skipIf` / `Bun.which`. Use `tests/support/agentRuns.ts` and `clock.ts` for timing-sensitive tests.
